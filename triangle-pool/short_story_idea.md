# The Man in the Drainage Pool

PVO: first person present.
Mood: terror

Gassing up late at night under the bright lights of a highway gas station. There's a drainage pool, triangular in shape, full of water, tens of feet away.

POV sees movement in the pool -- there's an entity (unsure what it is) in the pool. Looks like a man, standing waist-deep in the pool, but in the dark, only sillhouetted from passing cars. No one else around.

POV gets creeped out, calls police. Office is sucked into the pool. Entity rises further up out of the water whenever POV lets go of the gas pump handle.

Another night without her, thank god. I park under the gas station's roof, well lit, and in view of at least two cameras.
