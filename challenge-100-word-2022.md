## Brain dump

Emotional and relational development
Conflict is central, though may be internal.

Sunbathing. Dealing with depression. Being filled by the sun, full of emotion. Returning to life.

A partner who doesn't understand that sun is life, and that there is more to life than avoiding melanoma.

Intro Develop Twist Reconcile

### Mental Illness
I: Person angry at partner.
D: Partner spends too much time sunbathing. Reckless, short-sighted, cancer-causing.
T: Depression kills faster than cancer.
R: Sunbath until your emotions are full.

I: I come from a family of doctors; I'm not full of lies.
D: We all agree, you spend too much time in the sun. How 
T: "Depression kills faster than cancer."
R: Everytime I look out the window and see a pretty woman, I'm reminded of her.

Nominally about 'too much time outside', but narrator is conceited and...what? abusive? gaslighting? manipulative? unhealthy.

Okay, I like the sunbathing + depression angle. Let's try a few others.

Realistic characters, emotional themes, depth, moral grappling, conflict.

Narrator is jealous of partner's body --- and the attention it receives --- and tries to sabatoge her for years

Vitamin D
<!-- Draft: 97 words -->
"My parents are dermatologists," I lied. "They say to limit sun exposure." You never liked my family; for years, you ignored their advice.

A month before our wedding, I was still lying. "Your skin is on fire; I should be your light. Come spend time with me, inside."

You never listened to me.

Instead, you shouted that I never understood, never tried. Then you said the only words I still hear.

"Depression kills faster than cancer."

Now I sit, parents long dead, belly full of beer, watching women suntanning on the beach.

All I see is you.

### Procrastination and Disappointment
Using sunbathing as an escape from hard choices. A college student perfects his beach bod so he doesn't have to face the reality that he's going to fail out of college and go back home to disappointed family and a life of no prospects in a dead-end town. Sun as opportunity. Home town has no sun.

I: Beach volleyball, suntanning. Fill up spring break.
D: Enjoy spring break while I can.
T: My family worked hard to send me to college, enduring months without sun.
R: My friends all work hard in school. They'll live in the sun. I'm failing out this semester. Back to home. All out of sun.

A Sun-touched Land
<!-- Draft: 96 words -->
Ran the beach this morning. In the gym after dark. Now I sit, suntanning. Blue sky above, blue ocean below, the rocking boat pulls cares away.

Spring break will end, but the semester is not over yet. I turn over to bronze more once-pale skin.

Rain clouds choke my home town. We used boards, not windows. 'For Sale' and 'Foreclosed' were neighbors. My parents fought years of no sun to send me here, to college, where the sun shines.

Next year, my friends will return again to days full of sun. I'll need a raincoat.

### Infidelity
Child plays in the sand. Mommy's been sunbathing a long time. Dad took the car. Tears behind mommy's sunglasses.
Her white bathing suit moving further and further from her reddening skin.

She says build a sandcastle. I look out at my collection.

### Disease: Cancer + Infidelity
I: Regular suntanner, there when the beach opens. Month after month.
D: I don't burn. I pull out hair instead.
T: My husband is in the mountains. Been there since my head stopped being full.
R: Doctors say that sun exposure is good, that it'll help me beat this cancer. All I want is to lose the indent at the base of my ring finger before I go.

### Social anxiety

D:
T:
R:


### Pepper's feedback
> I did one of their other contests back in November- it was a good exercise, and I got decent feedback on the literal quality of my writing.
> I think Vitamin D is stronger because it tells more of a story, whereas A Sun-Touched Land is a bit more poetic. That said, I'm not entirely sure of the events in Vitamin D, (what exactly happened between the husband and wife) whereas I am sure of the takeaway in Sun-Touched. I think if you can make the plot progression clearer in Vitamin D, it's the better submission for this particular contest, but if not, then Sun-Touched is a more cohesive piece, although the emotions from it aren't as (comparatively) strong.
> Hope you make it to round 2!
