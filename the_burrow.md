## Idea dump

Teens running from robotic dogs. Hiding under an overpass or LA River canals. One character thinks they are safe (refuge), the other doesn't (Ominous). Why the different? What do we learn about the second character?

Teens doing something (future drugs / consumption) that the robots should ignore (show familiarity, demonstrate a reader-strange normalcy from characters). Character brings something unexpected to the group, which increased perceived danger.

Teens on a neutral space ship. They're hanging out, exploring whatever. They come across agents aligned to The War and, after being discovered, escape into the deeper parts of the space station. (Where they discover great and terrible self-defense / self-destruct mechanisms). They return to the space station proper, worried that they'll be recognized, suspicious that any person they see could be bringing the War closer.
(Orbital RPG)

## Story Craft

1. Introduction (Refuge: familiar, safe)

# The Station
Starting truth for the station:
- We are a neutral station, widely recognised as unaffiliated with either side of the ongoing war.
- The station is much older than our little community and much of it is unexplored.
- We have sufficient resources to ensure we meet all our residents’ basic needs.
- We celebrate and value difference in many forms, both personal and cultural.
- We operate open borders, accepting new arrivals with compassion and providing for them as equal residents.
- The world outside is hostile and treacherous, so we avoid leaving our station wherever possible.

## Look and Feel
### Aesthetic Touchstones
Rough stone and rusted steel
Metal grating
Hexagonal blastdoors

#### Rough shape and scale
An approximate cylinder, half the size of Luna. Termites in a broken moon.

### Things we Found
Defunct corporate branding
Bioluminescence

### Marks we Made
Community gardens
Painted routes

## Threats
Rowdy soldiers from both sides of the war have taken shore leave here
(they are obviously not of the station, which gives protags normalcy. Broken when they learn there are soldiers they can not identify)

(This is a short story, so I'll leave it at one threat)


## Station Name
- Original name: lost to time, named by long-defunct corporation
- Colloquial name: "Burrow"

# Aspects

## The Interstellar War.
An all-consuming conflict, burning across the stars.

The *two sides*
1. The republic
2. The union
Which came first is forgotten.

Their differences
1. The colors they wear
2. Their interpretation of the texts

## The Station Itself.
The systems, mundane and uncanny, keeping us alive.

Assistant's name: ABENA
Directives
1. Protect that which grows within
2. Prepare for the return of the makers

## The Markets.
The ways we trade for resources on this station.

The *outside investor*: Fee-Nix
Their intentions
1. Make us a tourist destination
2. Offer conditional safety

## The Scum and Villainy.
The smugglers, gangsters & thieves haunting our station.

The two major gangs
1. The Half-Coins (reckless)
2. The Kutpit Family (ambitious)

## The Unaffiliated.
The families, workers & refugees making up our diverse society

An upcoming event: Lilac Festival (when the station's bioluminescence turns purple for three nights)

Naming system: haphazard and unplanned

## The Lambent Strand.
A glowing thread, weaving every life together into a great tapestry.

Also called _the current_ or _the clearing_.

Two ways we see it:
1. a holistic energy
2. smoke and mirrors

# Major characters

## The Teen (1)
What have the adults failed to teach you?
Is your voice heard? And when is it listened to?
How will your growing powers shape you?


### Character Profile
My name is |name| (he/him).

I'm human, and when you first see me you'll probably notice my dyed hair, lanky appendages, and disinterested stance.

I wear a brand-name shirt, torn pants, and alwasys carry my heavily-stickered hoverboard.

As much of a pain it is to go to school, I'm always excited to learn about microbioprogramming but hate station civics, even though I wish I could just be practicing tricks. After school, you can usually find me hanging out with my friends exploring restricted sections or at my part time job as a cashier at The Angry Ape.

I consider myself brilliant and confident, but all the adults tell me to be more respectable.

When can I just be myself?

### Connections
* What lie did |Teen 2| tell me that I know is untrue?

(6, 1)
* A teacher who lets me off the hook
* My try-hard, obnoxious coworker

### Insights
I was caught at ground zero with my friends.


## The Teen (2)
What have the adults failed to teach you?
Is your voice heard? And when is it listened to?
How will your growing powers shape you?


### Character Profile
My name is |name| (she/her).

I'm human, and when you first see me you'll probably notice my acne scars, proud colors, and chatty attitude.

I wear thrifted hand-me-downs, a mess of pins, and alwasys carry a canvas bag of spray paint.

As much of a pain it is to go to school, I'm always excited to learn about void construction but hate history, even though I wish I could just be finding new tagging spots. After school, you can usually find me hanging out with my friends exploring restricted sections or at my part time job as a line cook at the On-Planet Diner.

I consider myself insightful and persistent, but all the adults tell me to be more patient.

When can I just be myself?

### Connections
What lie did |Teen 1| tell me that I know is untrue?

(3, 6)
* An old classmate turned new crush
* My try-hard, obnoxious coworker

### Insights
