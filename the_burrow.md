## Idea dump

Teens running from robotic dogs. Hiding under an overpass or LA River canals. One character thinks they are safe (refuge), the other doesn't (Ominous). Why the different? What do we learn about the second character?

Teens doing something (future drugs / consumption) that the robots should ignore (show familiarity, demonstrate a reader-strange normalcy from characters). Character brings something unexpected to the group, which increased perceived danger.

Teens on a neutral space ship. They're hanging out, exploring whatever. They come across agents aligned to The War and, after being discovered, escape into the deeper parts of the space station. (Where they discover great and terrible self-defense / self-destruct mechanisms). They return to the space station proper, worried that they'll be recognized, suspicious that any person they see could be bringing the War closer.
(Orbital RPG)

## Story Craft

1. Introduction (Refuge: familiar, safe)
2. Development (Innocuous: unfamiliar, safe)
3. Twist (Void: unfamiliar, unsafe)
2. Reconciliation (Ominous: familiar, unsafe)

# The Station
Starting truth for the station:
- We are a neutral station, widely recognised as unaffiliated with either side of the ongoing war.
- The station is much older than our little community and much of it is unexplored.
- We have sufficient resources to ensure we meet all our residents’ basic needs.
- We celebrate and value difference in many forms, both personal and cultural.
- We operate open borders, accepting new arrivals with compassion and providing for them as equal residents.
- The world outside is hostile and treacherous, so we avoid leaving our station wherever possible.


Once you’ve established these truths, you can start to make the Station unique. First, by choosing a few aesthetic touchstones describing the physical environment.
These visuals don’t need to be ubiquitous across the Station, but paint in broad strokes. You should also agree on your Station’s rough shape and size so you’re all agreed on the scale.

## Look and Feel
### Aesthetic Touchstones
Rough stone and rusted steel
Metal grating
Hexagonal blastdoors

#### Rough shape and scale
An approximate cylinder, half the size of Luna. Termites in a broken moon.

### Things we Found
Defunct corporate branding
Bioluminescence

### Marks we Made
Community gardens
Painted routes

## Threats
Rowdy soldiers from both sides of the war have taken shore leave here
(they are obviously not of the station, which gives protags normalcy. Broken when they learn there are soldiers they can not identify)

(This is a short story, so I'll leave it at one threat)


## Station Name
- Original name: lost to time, named by long-defunct corporation
- Colloquial name: "Burrow"
- Stellar designation: Issi-4

## Map

## Minor Characters
- name (they/them), short description, ROAARS
