# Title?
*At West Platte Ranch, we provide campers the experience of a lifetime*

"Really? Expelled in a day?"

Florence Grebe (curly brown hair on freckled white skin like her mother) slouched in the waiting room of *Dogsome Doggy Daycare*, her stepfather's latest business, between two massive cloth bags, her supplies for the week away.

Her stepfather, Pharoh, paced from the kitchen (where he was filling dog food bowls) and the front blinds, where he peeked through, looking across the strip mall's parking lot at the Consulate opposite.

After several passes of silence, Florence worked up the courage. "Are you mad?"

Pharoh paused, a small smile beneath narrow, confused eyes. "I don't care why they expelled you, but I promised your mother this camp was a good idea, and she's expecting a report card we can hang on the fridge."

Florence snorted as she rummaged through her backpack. "Hang this," she said, handing over a piece of white paper, her report card from camp. Six categories, all marked Did Not Finish. A handwritten explanation and a big red stamp, applied with such gusto that it left an imprint in the page, screamed *EXPELLED* in thick red ink.

"Mom's going to flip when she sees this."

"She won't see it," said Pharoh with the calm of a man who had yet to consider his plan.

*Fun-filled days await your pre-teen at Adventure Camp*

Florence, two food bowls in each hand, followed Pharoh to the feeding room.

"You want me to stay here a whole week?" She was shocked her stepfather would even suggest it.

Florence was more of a book person. Dogs were fine, but she'd rather groom them than play with them. At least then they smelled nice.

"Until Saturday, when you were due home. Your mother and I expected you'd be in the mountains this week, so we made evening plans."

Outside, the most astute dogs, those that knew feeding time was imminent, had crowded the glass door, barking and pawing for attention.

"What plans?"

Pharoh stumbled through several seconds of incoherent noise before settling on, "Just... plans."

"Look," continued Pharoh, "I need you to arrive home on Saturday with a smile on your face, sun on your skin, and a report card for the fridge. Play along and your mom doesn't even need to know about your expulsion. Deal?"

Florence nodded. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

*Experience has been our best teacher*

Pharoh took her report card and disappeared into the back office, saying "I can fix this. I used to work at the Embassy," leaving Florence to look after all the dogs.

The first day passed without issue. She walked and petted and fed and cleaned up after more dogs than reasonable. It wasn't until her father was packing up to leave for the night that the first real problem arose.

"Where am I supposed to sleep?"

"Anywhere but the waiting room, please. Grooming tables?"

"Dad!"

"What? Your bags have clothes for a week! Brush your teeth in the kitchen then an extra dog bed and find a place to sleep. I'll be back in the morning. Remember: you're still at summer camp."

With that, he left Florence alone.

*Expand the limits of your imagination*

Only twelve dogs were boarding overnight, but they more than filled the ten kennels that the *Dogsome* had available.

And they were not quiet sleepers.

The kitchen was too cold. The bathroom, too cramped. She ended up where her father suggested: in a pile of blankets on a grooming table.

And yet... the room was too dark. The building groaned. Outside, buzzing things with claws and fangs tapped on the glass, asking to get in. Florence tried to ignore them, to ignore the growing worry that they were already inside, crawling on a hundred legs up the table and under her skin.

She gathered her courage and her blankets, then searched for a new sleeping spot.

*Campers gain respect for themselves*

A sound awoke her pillow (an Alaskan Malamute named Snuggles), who lept out from under her with a bark.

Voices from the waiting room broke through the groggy fog on Florence's brain. Her senses sharpened when she realized this was not a morning drop-off. The words were too animated, too consistent.

Florence sat up.

Surrounded by blankets, she'd made a pile at the back of the small concrete stall. White and gray dog hair coated her clothes.

She wanted no part of the waiting room drama, especially looking like this. She yawned and stretched her arms toward the ceiling.

Then the doorknob to the waiting room turned. The boarded dogs all began barking.

Florence crumpled down to the floor, tossing a pair of blankets over her body, hoping the Malamute would hide her.

"Hey, quiet. Quiet!"

Her father.

Peeking out, Florence watched two pairs of shoes enter the kennels, stopping just outside her own.

"Pharoh, I need you to do this for me. He's a Consulate VIP. I've already promised that you'd have the dogs ready for the gala this evening." Florence clenched her jaw at hearing her mother's voice.

"Sure, but what about our plans, Stacey?" A hint of sadness tinged her father's words.

"Pharoh, sometimes plans change."

Pharoh sighed. "Fine, I'll get them groomed. I used to work at the Embassy, you know."

"Love, that isn't relevant here. I'll have them unload the dogs."

When the door latched, Florence sat up. Drawn by her movement, her father's face contorted as he looked down at her through the metal bars of the kennel door.

"What are you doing?" he hissed.

"I had to sleep somewhere."

"Nevermind, stay hidden. Snuggles, lie down."

Florence, under many blankets and one large, heavy dog, hid from the parade of tiny legs and yipping barks that returned with her mother's shoes.

*It's a chance to step out of your routine*

"Fifteen full spas?" Florence gawked at the horde of just-delievered dogs. "We only did eight a day last summer!"

"Full spa for each one. It pays well and means a lot to your mother. We can do this, Florence! Let's just find our routine."

Shampooing, washing, rinsing, rinsing again. Drying, clipping, trimming, combing.

The father-daughter pair found their flow.

*Every summer is a window of opportunity*

Twelve hours later, fifteen royal toy dogs, from Pekingese to English Spaniels, waited in line and on leash for their handler.

Three black SUVs pulled up. A white man in a fancy black suit came in, followed by three more sturdy suits. Every tail wagged at his arrival. "Ah, there they are, looking better than ever. How are you, Bailey? Muffin? Chip? You all look so shiny." He sniffed one of the Shih Tzus. "Ah, so fresh!"

The man turned to Pharoh. "Thank you, Dog Washer. Their Majesties will be most pleased. Now, excuse me, we have a doggy gala to attend." He turned away before Pharoh could respond, shouted "Load them up!" and exited.

Moments after the SUVs left, Stacey walked through the front door with a smile on her face. Florence, hidden in the corner, froze.

Stacey walked up to Pharoh and hugged him. "Thank you, Pharoh. That meant a lot to me. There are some people you just have to please."

Her father's face softened into a smile. "I couldn't have done it alone." He directed Stacey's attention to the corner where Florence was sitting.

Concern filled her mom's face. "Florence, Why aren't you at camp?"

Florence breathed through a grimace. "Plans change?"

*Unique experience cultivate resiliancy for every camper*

After her mother left, Florence stood watching the dogs in the yard with her father.

"What were you doing with my report card?"

Her stepfather smiled. "Don't worry about it. I used to work at the Embassy."

Behind the large white oak tree in the yard sat a big brown boxer, resting after its latest meal. Hanging from its collar was a tag with the word SHREDDER embossed across its face.
