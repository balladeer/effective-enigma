# Title?
*At Platte Ranch, we provide campers the experience of a lifetime*

"Expelled in a day?"

Florence (curly brown hair on freckled white skin like her mother) slouched in the waiting room of *Dogsome Doggy Daycare*, her stepfather's latest business, between two massive cloth bags.

Her stepfather, a round man with brown skin and black hair on his head and chin, paced from the kitchen to the blinds, stopping to peek across the parking lot at the Consulate opposite.

After several silent passes, Florence worked up the courage. "Are you mad?"

Pharoh paused. "I don't care why they expelled you, but I promised your mother this camp was a good idea. She's expecting a report card we can hang on the fridge."

Florence snorted as she rummaged through her backpack. "Hang this," she said, handing over a piece of white paper, her report card from camp.

Six categories, all Did Not Finish. A handwritten explanation and a big red stamp, applied with such gusto that it left an imprint, screamed *EXPELLED* in red ink.

"Mom's going to flip when she sees this."

"She won't see it," said Pharoh with the calm of a man who hadn't considered his plan.

*Fun-filled days await your pre-teen*

Florence, two food bowls in each hand, followed Pharoh.

"Stay here a whole week?" She was shocked her stepfather suggested it.

Florence was more of a book person. Dogs were fine, but she'd rather groom them than play with them. At least then they smelled nice.

"Until Saturday. Your supposed to be at camp, so your mother and I made evening plans."

Outside, the most astute dogs crowded the glass door, pawing for attention.

"What plans?"

Pharoh stumbled through some incoherent noise before settling on, "Just... plans."

"Look," continued Pharoh, "I need you to arrive home on Saturday with a smile on your face, sun on your skin, and a report card for the fridge. Play along and your mom doesn't need to know about your expulsion. Deal?"

Florence nodded. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

*Experience has been our best teacher*

Pharoh took her report card into the back office, saying "I can fix this. I used to work at the Embassy," which left Florence to look after all the dogs.

She walked and petted and fed and cleaned up after more smelly dogs than reasonable, but it wasn't until her father was packing up for the night that the first real problem arose.

"Where am I supposed to sleep?"

"Not the waiting room. Grooming tables?"

"Dad!"

"What? Your bags have clothes for a week! Brush your teeth in the kitchen. Grab a dog bed and get cozy. I'll be back in the morning. Remember, you're still at summer camp."

With that, he left.

*Expand the limits of your imagination*

Twelve dogs were boarding overnight, but they more than filled the ten kennels the *Dogsome* had available.

And they were not quiet sleepers.

The kitchen was too cold. The bathroom, too cramped. She ended up where her father suggested: in a pile of blankets on a grooming table.

And yet... the room was eerie in the dark. The building groaned. Buzzing things with claws and fangs tapped on the glass, asking to get in. Florence tried to ignore the growing worry that they were already inside, crawling on a hundred legs up the table and under her skin.

Gathering her courage and blankets, she searched for a new bed.

*Campers gain respect for themselves*

A sound awoke her pillow (an Malamute named Snuggles), who lept out from under her with a bark.

Voices from the waiting room broke through the groggy fog on Florence's brain, sharpening her sense when she realized this was not a morning drop-off.

Florence sat up.

Surrounded by blankets, she'd made a pile at the back of a small concrete stall. She wore more dog hair than fiber.

Florence yawned and stretched her arms toward the ceiling, in no rush to join the drama up front.

Then the doorknob to the waiting room turned. The boarded dogs barked.

Florence crumpled down, tossing a pair of blankets over her body.

"Hey, quiet. Quiet!"

Her father.

Peeking out, Florence watched two pairs of shoes enter the kennels, stopping just outside her own.

"Pharoh, I need you to do this for me. He's a Consulate VIP. I promised that you'd have the dogs ready for the gala this evening." Florence clenched her jaw at hearing her mother's voice.

"Sure, but what about our plans tonight, Stacey?" A hint of sadness tinged her father's words.

"Pharoh, sometimes plans change."

Pharoh sighed. "Fine, I'll get them groomed. I used to work at the Embassy, you know."

"That was years ago, love. I'll have them unload the dogs."

When the door latched, Florence sat up. Drawn by her movement, her father's face contorted as he looked down  through the metal bars of the kennel.

"What are you doing?" he hissed.

"I had to sleep somewhere."

"Nevermind, stay hidden. Snuggles, lie down."

Florence, under many blankets and one heavy dog, hid from the parade of yipping barks that returned with her mother's shoes.

*It's a chance to step out of your routine*

"Fifteen full spas?" Florence gawked at the horde of just-delievered dogs. "We only did eight a day last summer!"

"Full spa for each one. We can do this, Florence! Let's just find our routine."

Shampooing, washing, rinsing, rinsing again. Drying, clipping, trimming, combing.

The father-daughter pair found their flow, and it smelled amazing.

*Every summer is a window of opportunity*

Twelve hours later, fifteen dogs, from Pekingese to English Spaniels, waited in line and on leash.

Three black SUVs pulled up. A white man in a fancy black suit came in. Every tail wagged at his arrival. "Ah, there they are! How are you, Bailey? Muffin? Chip? You all look so shiny!" He sniffed one of the Shih Tzus. "So fresh!"

The man turned to Pharoh. "Thank you, Dog Washer. Their Majesties will be most pleased."" He turned away before Pharoh could respond, shouted "Load them up!" and exited.

Moments after the SUVs left, Stacey walked in with a smile on her face. Florence, sitting in the corner, froze.

Her mother walked up to Pharoh and hugged him. "Thank you. That meant a lot to me."

Her father's face softened into a smile. "I couldn't have done it alone." He directed Stacey's attention to Florence's corner.

Concern filled her mom's eyes. "Why aren't you at camp?"

Florence breathed through a grimace.

"Plans change?"

*Unique experience cultivate resiliancy for every camper*

Florence stood watching the dogs in the yard with her father.

"That went well," he said.

"What were you doing with my report card yesterday?"

Her stepfather smiled. "Don't worry about it. I used to work at the Embassy."

Behind the large white oak tree in the yard sat a big brown boxer, resting after its latest meal. Hanging from its collar was a tag with the word SHREDDER embossed across its face.
