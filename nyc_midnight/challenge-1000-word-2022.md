# Microfiction 2022 - 1000 word challenge

NYC Midnight's 100-word challenge, 2022.

## Genre definition: COMEDY

From [the nycmidnight website](https://www.nycmidnight.com/genres)

A story that typically maintains a light, satirical, or familiar tone and features amusing characters and situations. Humor is the fundamental driving force. The word “comedy” comes from the Greek word komos, which means revelry or merry-making--and indeed, comedy has its origins in ancient Athens, where it was used in celebrations dedicated to the Greek god of wine and revelry. Subgenres of comedies include screwball comedies, which derive humor from improbable situations and characters, black comedies, which have darker undertones, and romantic comedies, which focus on the antics of lovestruck characters. Common elements: love and sex, stock characters and situations, everyday speech, puns, and cheerful endings. Comedy books include Douglas Adams’s The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and Zadie Smith’s The Autograph Man. Comedy films include This is Spinal Tap (1984) and Anchorman (2004).

## Brain Dump

Characters try (and sometimes fail) to remain poised in the face of disorder.

This feels like a Fiasco game, so let's lean in on that:
- Relationships, needs, locations, and objects.

We already have the location (A dog daycare facility) and object (a report card)

Let's generate some relationships and needs and see where that takes us.

Hell, if you Kishōtenketsu it, this reads a lot like a Fiasco story, Tilt and all.


## Silly Ideas

- An event nearby overbooks the dog day care, resulting in _way too many dogs_.
	+ Showing up from out of town last minute, with a pile of dogs
- Dogs barking making it hard to hear each other.
- Getting trampled by an avalanche of snuggly dogs.
- Dog washing chemicals and tools
- Dog hair everywhere
- A trashcan full of dog poop
- A hole in the fence
- The taunting cats
- Destroying the original report card because "they didn't think it would be so hard" to make a forgery.

### More stuff

- Overconfidence
- Poorly timed coincidences
- Excess
- Hubris

**Report Card**: a teacher's written appraisal of a pupil's work, progress and conduct
- a school teacher to an elementary student
- a dog trainer to a dog('s owner)
- a (demeaning) report from a diplomat to the consulate's staff

### Fiasco Setup

Persons Florence, Pharoh, and Stacey

Florence + Pharoh
- Relationship: Stepchild and parent
- Location: A dog daycare facility

Pharoh + Stacey
- Relationship: Current Spouses
- Need: To get respect through a re-written *report card*

Stacey + Florence
- Relationship: Parent and Child
- Object: A Report Card

A: Adult consulate employee
B: Teen-age employee at a dog daycare and spa
C: pre-teen child of A, friends w/ B.

Kicked out of summer camp three days early, sophomore Florence Grebe returns to her stepfather's Doggy Daycare to avoid her mother's disappointment for a few hours longer. Instead, her stepfather hatches a plan to hide Florence with the dogs while they fake a successful summer camp.

## Alternates to keep around
- A dog daycare next to a consulate. A diplomat distraught that their kids' report card was included in the pile of 'to be discretely destroyed' paper sent next door. (report card is inciting incident, but not sure what's next)
- Two children try to forge a better report card because their parent promised 'big money' if they got good grades. (No real tie to the doggy daycare)

## Blarg
Step-father runs the dog daycare.
Daughter brings bad report card.
Step father sets about to forge a new copy, leaving child to run the dog day care.

What goes wrong?
- Father cuts himself, they end up using the dog-washer stations to wash him off, but he just gets covered in dog hair.
- Daughter goes to door, comes back with twelve dogs on a leash, says a man dropped them off and left.
	+ Not enough kennels for the dogs.

Kicked out of summer camp three days early, sophomore Florence Grebe returns to her step-father's Doggy Daycare to avoid her mother's disappointment for a few hours longer. Instead, her step-father hatches a plan to hide Florence with the dogs while they fake a successful summer camp.

Pharoh says "I used to work at the embassy" but never says which one. Hint that he used to be a spy.

# Intro

Florence shows up at Dogsome Daycare after getting kicked out of Summer Camp for !!reason!!.

Her stepdad, Pharoh, brings her inside quickly, then peaks through the window to see if anyone might have seen her from across the parking lot at the Consulate of Guatemala, where Stacey, Pharoh's wife and Florence's mother, works.

Florence is wary: she expects both Pharoh and Stacey to be mad that she got kicked out, but Pharoh seems....accomodating?

She learns that Pharoh promised Stacey this summer camp would be good for Florence, that she'd come back with a great report card "worthy of the fridge."

"Well, she's going to flip when she sees this." Florence slides her report card -- along with a note explaining why she was kicked out -- onto the table.

Pharoh ignores the note and scans the report card.



<!-- Lampshare the 'dog ate homework' cliche by having Pharoh feed documents to his 'Shredder' -->
> Why don't you use a shredder?

> I am -- this here is Shredder. Isn't that right? Aren't you my big shredder pup?

> Her name is Snowball!

> Not to me.


# Draft
<!-- 3rd-person omniscient. The Storyteller's voice -->

<!-- PHYS: Florence - opportunity -->
Disguised under four layers of mountain gear, Florence kept her face away from the consulate on the other side of the parking lot.

The sagging front door of *Dogsome Doggy Daycare* rang with shallow *thwaps* under her knocking hand.

"Coming!" came a hurried voice.

The door cracked open.

"Name?" asked the voice inside.

"Florence," whispered Florence.

"Huh...not dog by that name."

"Dad, its me. Florence."

<!-- PHYS: Pharoh - opportunity -->
Her father's balding head peeked out, eyes widening as he took in the sight of his step-daughter, bundled up like a toddler in the winter, with two large green cloth sacks on either side of her.

His stepdaughter was supposed to be at summer camp, not standing outside his business, in full view of the consulate across the parking lot.

Pharoh Taylor pulled open the door and hurried setpdaughter inside.

"Leave the bags, I'll get them!"

With two large bags and one small daughter inside, Pharoh peeked thorugh the blinds next to the door, looking for movement.

<!-- A potential theme: "Removing excess layers" -->
"Do you think she saw?" asked Florence as she removed her excess layers.

"No, no. Let's hope not." Pahroh withdrew from the window.

The two stood in the front office and doggy-drop off. The low ceiling's speckled white tiles were stained yellow and brown from water damage.

"What are you doing here? Summer camp isn't over for another three days!"

Florence dropped into the cheap plastic chair beside the dry aquarium that decorated the lobby.

"Not for me. Apparently there are rooms you're not allowed to enter."

Florence sighed. "Mind if I stay here until dinner? I don't want to face mom's disappointment."

"Neither do I."

"What?"

"I told her camp would be good for you. That you'd come back with a report card worthy of the fridge."

"Why'd you promise that?"

"...I said I'd help you earn it."

"Well you didn't!"

"I didn't...yet. We still have three days."

"I got kicked out!"

"Irrelevant! I promised your mother a report card for the fridge."

*At West Platte Ranch, we commit to providing every camper an experience for a lifetime*

"Really, Florence? Expelled in a day?"

Florence Grebe (curly brown hair on freckled white skin, like her mother; fourteen years old, unlike her mother) sat in the waiting room of *Dogsome Doggy Daycare and Spa*, her stepfather's latest business, slouched between two massive cloth bags, her supplies for the week away.

Her stepfather, Pharoh, paced from the kitchen (where he was filling twenty-seven individual food bowls) and the front blinds, where he peeked through, looking across the strip mall's parking lot to the Consulate on the far side.

It took Florence a dozen passes, but she worked up the courage to ask, "Are you mad?"

Pharoh paused on his way back to the kitchen, a small smile beneath narrow, confused eyes. He wiped some shining sweat from forehead. "I don't care why you were expelled from summer camp. But I promised your mother this camp was a good idea, and she's expecting a report card we can hang on the fridge."

Florence snorted as she sat up. "Hang this on the fridge," she said as she rummaged for a thick piece of white paper, her report card from summer camp. Six categories, all marked DNF (did not finish). Angry handwriting explained the situation in more words than necessary, and a big red stamp, applied with such gusto that it left an imprint in the middle of the page, screamed *EXPELLED* in think red ink.

"Mom's going to flip when she sees this."

"She's not going to see it." Pharoh spoke with the calm of a man who had yet to consider his plan.

*Five fun-filled days await your loved one at our pre-teen Adventure Camp.*

Florence, carrying two food bowls in each hand, followed Pharoh to the feeding room.

"You want me to stay here a whole week?" Florence walked mouth open and wide-eyed, shocked her stepfather would even suggest it. She was more of a book person than a dog person. Dogs were fine, but she'd rather groom them than play with them.

"Just until Saturday, when you were due home. Your mother and I expected you'd be in the mountains this week, so we made evening plans."

Outside, the most astute dogs, those that knew feeding time was imminent, had begun crowding the glass door, barking and pawing for attention.

"What kind of plans?"

Pharoh stumbled through several seconds of incoherent noise before settling on, "Just...plans."

"Look," continued Pharoh, "I need you to arrive home on Saturday with a smile on your face, sun on your skin, and a report card for the fridge. Play along and your mom doens't even need to know about your expulsion. How's that sound?"

Florence nodded. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

*Since our founding in 1989, experience has been best teacher.*

Pharoh took her report card and disappeared into the back office. "I used to work at the Embassy" was all he said as he closed the door, leaving Florence to look after the dogs in his care.

The first day passed without issue. She walked and petted and fed and cleaned up after more dogs than reasonable (her stepfather was between employees).

It wasn't until her father was packing up to leave for the night that the next phase of the plan became apparent.

"Where am I supposed to sleep?"

"Anywhere but the waiting room, please. Maybe the grooming tables?"

"Dad!"

"What? You're all packed for a week away! Just grab some blankets or an extra dog bed and find a place to sleep. I'll be back in the morning. Remember: you're still at summer camp."

With that, he left Florence alone.

Only twelve dogs were boarding overnight, but they more than filled the ten kennels that the *Dogsome* had available. And they were not quiet sleepers.

The kitchen was too cold. That bathroom too cramped. She ended up where her father suggested: sleeping on a pile of blankets atop the shiny silver surface of a grooming table.

*Expand the limits of your imagination*

And yet...the room was dark. The building groaned. Outside in the yard, buzzing things with claws and fangs tapped on the glass, asking to get in. Florence tried to ignore them, to ignore the growing worry that they were already inside, crawling on a hundred legs up the table and under the covers with her.

*Ranchers gain respect for themselves and others*

Her pillow, warm and soft, lept out from under her with a bark, leaving her head to fall onto the concrete below. Her pillow (an Alaskan Malamute named Snuggles) sat in front of the kennel door, tail wagging at the thought of food and playtime.

Adult voices in the waiting room broke through the groggy fog on Florence's brain. Her senses sharpened as she realized this was not a morning dropoff. The words were too animated, too consistent.

Florence sat up.

She was surrounded by blankets, a pile at the back of the small concrete stall she'd slept in. Long white and gray dog hair coated her face and clothes.  Light under the door to the feeding room hinted at morning sun.

She wanted no part of the waiting room drama, especially like this. She yawned and stretched her arms toward the ceiling.

Then the door knob to the waiting room turned. The boarded dogs all began barking.

Florence stifled a gasp, then crumpled down to the floor. She tossed a pair of blankets over her body, hoping the Malamute's bed would hide her. She shut her eyes tight as if it would help.

"Hey, quiet. Quiet!" Her father.

Peeking out from beneath her blankets, Florence saw two pairs of shoes from under the kennel door.

"Pharoh, I need you to do this for me. He's a VIP at the Consulate and I've already promised him you could have the dogs ready in time for the gala." Florence clenched her jaw at hearing her mother's voice.

"I mean, maybe, but what about our plans, Stacey?" A hint of sadness tinged her father's words.

"Pharoh, sometimes plans change."

With a sigh, Pharoh aquiesced. "Fine, fine. I'll get them groomed. I used to work at the Embassy, you know."

"Pharoh, love, that work isn't relevant here. I'll let my VIP know and have them unload the dogs."

When the door latched, Florence sat up. Drawn by her movement, her father's face contorted as he looked down at her through the metal bars of the kennel door.

"What are you doing in there?" he hissed.

"I had to sleep somewhere."

"Nevermind, get back down. Stay hidden. Snuggles, lie down."

Florence under many blankets and one large, heavy dog, stayed hidden as a parade of tiny white legs paraded into through the kennel.

By the time her father had concluded whatever business he had in the waiting room, Florence was coated in sweat, overheating but afraid to move.

...
Fifteen royal dogs, from Pekingese and Japanese Chin to Shih Tzu and English Toy Spaniels waited on leash and in a line, waiting for their handler to return.

Three black SUVs pulled up. A white man in a fancy black suit came in, followed by three more in sturdy suits. Every tail wagged at his arrival. "Ah, there they are, looking better than ever. How are you doing, Bailey? And Muffin? Chip? Ginger? You all look so clean and shiny." He picked one of the Shih Tzus up and smelled her. "Ah, and your smell so fresh! Their Magesties will be so please."

The man turned to Pharoh. "Thank you, Mr. Dog Washer. My associate at the Consulate was right, you were up to the task. Now, if you'll excuse me, we have a gala to attend." He turned away before Pharoh could respond, shouted "Load them up!" and kicked the front door open.

Moments after the SUVs left, the front door opened once more. Florence's mother, Stacey, walked in with a smile on her face. Florence froze. 

Stacey walked up to Pharoh and hugged him. "Thank you, Pharoh. That meant a lot to me."

Her father's face softened into a smile. "I couldn't have done it alone." He directed Stacey's attention to the corner wher Florence was sitting.

Concern filled her mom's face. Florence wished she were anywhere else.

"Florence, honey, what happened? Why aren't you at camp right now?"

Florence grimaced, then took a deep breath and looked at her mother.

"Plans change?"
...









Outside, sitting under the shade of the large white oak tree in the yard, sat a big brown boxer, resting after its recent meal. Hanging from its collar was a bowl-shaped tag with the word SHREDDER embossed across its face.

# Draft 3

"Sorry, w'ere full todya. You'll need to make an appointment."

"No, it's Florence."

"florenct? Wd don't have a dog  by that name today."

"No, dad. It's ME. Florence" She spoke through gritte dteeth, as if raising her voice might alert her mother on the othersid eof the parking lot.

The sagging metal door swung opoen and her father, a round face on a round body, gaped out.

"Florence?! Get inside, come on."

Inside, Florence removed the many layers of coat ashe had been wearing to hide her appearance.  Her father peered through teh blinds at the consulate on the other end of the parking lot, as if he had telescoping eyes capable of seeing that far.

When no activity emerged, he withdrwe and truend to face his setpdaugher.

"What are you doing here? You'er supposed to be at---"

"I got kicked out. Apparently there are rooms at campy ou're not supposed to enter."

Pharoh wiped a hand down his face.

"I had them drop me off here because I didn't want to face mom."

A curious squirrel elicited a rumbling ruckus of barks from the dozen dogs playing in the yard behind the building.

"Your mother and I have dinner plans this evening. You're not supposed to be home until tomorow. She's going to be so disappointed."

"Wait, dad, why are you biting your nails?" Pharoh's nails never needed clipping as chewed them when he was nervous or stressed.

"I promised Stacey that this camp would be good for you, that you'd come back...better."

"It was a week---"

"---four days."

"How much did you think it would change me?"

"Look, I promised your mother a report card worthy of the fridge."

"Lol, so much for that. Here, stick this on the fridge." 

Florence slid a piece of thick cardstock over to her stepfather. Six categories, all DNF (did not finish). Angry handwriting explaining the situation in more words than prudent. And a big red stamp applied with such gusto that it left an imprint in the middle of the page: EXPELLED. Mr. Mathiasen (the head counselor) had a great deal of frustrations in his life, and that stamp had let him express just one.

"Mom's going to flip when she sees this."

"She's not goin to see this," Pharoh stated flatly, staring through the page, through Florence. His eyes focused. "I promised her a report card worthy of the fridge. That's what she's getting."

Pharoh, report card in hand, steppd past Florence, who stood up to follow. "You'll need to spend the night here, of course. She can't know that you were expelled."

"Wait, dad, what?"

Pharoh stopped at the door to the back office and turned to Florence, hand on the knob.

"You'll stay here and help care for the dogs. Out of sight. I'll deal with the report card."

He slipped into the office, door closing before Florence could follow.

"What do you mean you'll deal with the report card?"

"Don't worry about it! I used to work at the Embassy!"

Florence huffed. Her father said that whenever he was about to do something stupid.

# Draft 4

## Intro
<!-- Florence works at the Dogsome Doggy Daycare, keeping a low-profile. -->
<!-- She rejects a late drop-off through the door. Too many dogs already. -->
<!-- Pharoh is unavailable in the back office. -->

*Dogsome Doggy Daycare*. Florence liked the name, even if she cringed everytime her stepfather said it out loud. He was in the back office saving her tail, which left Florence to run the business for the morning.

Another late arrival, this one a pair of small black dogs (Belgian Schipperkes) hopped down from the sedan with their owner.

"I'm sorry," said Florence through the crack in the sagging metal door, "We're all full today. Make a booking in advance next time."

She swung the door closed before the woman could finish saying "I did!"

After the Shipperkes left, Florenced peeked through the blinds, eyeing the Consulate on the far side of the strip mall's parking lot. She'd made it through two hours without being spotted.

Seventy to go.

## Develop
<!-- Florence sees her three nice SUVs pull up to the consulate, then her mother exits and gets inside. -->
At noon, after feeding all twenty seven current doggy-residents, cleaning up the yard, and doing anything to keep her mind off the weekend, Florence snuck another peek across the lot. Three black SUVs sat in a line, waiting to deposit or consume someone important. A sharp black suit emerged from the building, followed by 

<!-- Florence watches with relief: her mother must be attending a convention. -->


<!-- Relief turns to dread when the SUVs just cross the parking lot, stopping in front of the doggy daycare. -->

<!-- Florence panics and locks the front door, begging her father to come out and meet the SUVs + her mother, who work at the consulate. -->

<!-- POV switch to Pharoh, who emerges and deals with the people at the door, convincing Stacey's VIP that he was tardy because he was caring for a dog. -->

<!-- Stacey politely demands that Pharoh care for the many, many dogs of the VIP's employers, who wants them boarded for the night and groomed for 'an event' the next day. -->

<!-- Stacey is all polite indifference, making promises as if Pharoh is a trusted business partner and not her husband. Pharoh plays along. (callback to "I used to work at the Embassy")-->

<!-- Pharoh takes Stacey back to the hallway outside the office. "What about dinner tonight? We made plans!" "Plans change. Please, I need this buffoon to be happy, and groomed dogs are how that happens." "I'll have them ready in the morning -- though they'll be exhausted."  "All I need is for them to look good." -- setup for revelation about Pharoh making the report card 'look good'.-->

## Twist
<!-- POV switch to Florence, who is admiring the forged report card the Pharoh is working on. -->

<!-- Her father calls her out of the office, each hand full of leashes. Over a dozen tiny dogs -- toy breeds like Pekingese, Japanese Chin, Shih Tzu, and English Toy Spaniels gathered around his shins -- along with a single Scottish Deerhound up to his chest. -->

<!-- He asks if she still remembers how to groom a dog. Of course...she worked here for many summers; she's the reason Pharoh and Stacey met. -->

<!-- "Well, looks like you won't be sleeping in the kennels, because we've got fifteen dogs to groom for and important event tomorrow morning." 

"Can't be that important if they're having a dog spa next to the consulate do the work. It's not even at the embassy?"
-->

<!-- "What about my report card? My expulsion from summer camp?" -->

<!-- "Help me pull this off, and I don't think any of that will matter." -->

## Reconciliation
<!-- They spend the night grooming dogs, one at a time, letting the others sleep wherever they choose. -->

<!-- In the morning, VIP returns w/ Stacey. Pharoh parades the dogs out, introduces his assisstant, 'Angela', to VIP. Stacey glares, but plays along, thanking Pharoh and Angela for their quick turnaround. VIP is thrilled. -->

<!-- Stacey hangs back ('get the invoice'). Quietly asks what Florence is doing home from summer camp. -->

<!-- Florence smiles sheepishly and says, "Plans change." -->
