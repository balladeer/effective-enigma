# Microfiction 2022 - 1000 word challenge

NYC Midnight's 100-word challenge, 2022.

## Genre definition: COMEDY
From [the nycmidnight website](https://www.nycmidnight.com/genres)

A story that typically maintains a light, satirical, or familiar tone and features amusing characters and situations. Humor is the fundamental driving force. The word “comedy” comes from the Greek word komos, which means revelry or merry-making--and indeed, comedy has its origins in ancient Athens, where it was used in celebrations dedicated to the Greek god of wine and revelry. Subgenres of comedies include screwball comedies, which derive humor from improbable situations and characters, black comedies, which have darker undertones, and romantic comedies, which focus on the antics of lovestruck characters. Common elements: love and sex, stock characters and situations, everyday speech, puns, and cheerful endings. Comedy books include Douglas Adams’s The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and Zadie Smith’s The Autograph Man. Comedy films include This is Spinal Tap (1984) and Anchorman (2004).

## Brain Dump

Interesting bits from Fiasco's *Tales from Suburbia*

What would this prompt look like as a Wes Anderson film?
- maybe silly adult runs a hidden business where they have the dogs eat children's homework / report cards as a scheme to...

This feels like a Fiasco game, so let's lean in on that:
- Relationships, needs, locations, and objects.

We already have the location (A dog daycare facility) and object (a report card)

Let's generate some relationships and needs and see where that takes us.

Hell, if you Kishōtenketsu it, this reads a lot like a Fiasco story, Tilt and all.


- An event nearby overbooks the dog day care, resulting in _way too many dogs_.
	+ Showing up from out of town last minute, with a pile of dogs
- Dogs barking making it hard to hear each other.
- Getting trampled by an avalanche of snuggly dogs.
- Dog washing chemicals and tools
- Dog hair everywhere
- A trashcan full of dog poop
- A hole in the fence
- The taunting cats

### More stuff
- Overconfidence
- Poorly timed coincidences
- Excess
- Hubris

Destroying the original report card because "they didn't think it would be so hard" to make a forgery.

### Some tilts:
- Somebody is watching, waiting for their moment
- You thought it was taken care of but it wasn't
- A showdown 
- A well-meaning stranger intervenes

- Someone loses their nerve
- Ill-considered violence
- "I love you"
- Impotent rage

A cat, a dog, and the doggy day care they live in.
- a loyal dog eats their kid-owner's report card because it causes them stress. After learning what they've done from the cat, the two of them attempt to make things right in the dead of night.

All the dogs at the daycare run a whispers network to hlep their little humans by eating the semester report cards.

----

The easy stuff
- dogs eat report card
	+ Dogs earn report card, children eat it


- Isle of Dogs: doggy daycare is treated as wasteland / war zone. Humor in the extremes.


A dog daycare next to a consulate. A diplomat distraught that their kids' report card was included in the pile of 'to be discretely destroyed' paper sent next door.

**Report Card**: a teacher's written appraisal of a pupil's work, progress and conduct
- a school teacher to an elementary student
- a dog trainer to a dog('s owner)
- a (demeaning) report from a diplomat to the consulate's staff


Someone in a hurry brings cats to the dog park.

I need to ... and this report card is my ticket!

Give me that report card! I promised your mother your grades would improve, not that you'd be smarter!

Step-father runs the dog daycare.
Daughter brings bad report card.
Step father sets about to forge a new copy, leaving child to run the dog day care.

What goes wrong?
- Father cuts himself, they end up using the dog-washer stations to wash him off, but he just gets covered in dog hair.
- Daughter goes to door, comes back with twelve dogs on a leash, says a man dropped them off and left.
	+ Not enough kennels for the dogs.


Rewrite the report card.


Alright Zachary, do you want to go with stepfather + daughter, or two children.


> Aren't you in calligraphy? 
> Calligraphy doesn't mean I mimic other people!"


Characters try (and sometimes fail) to remain poised in the face of disorder.

Kicked out of summer camp three days early, sophomore Florence Grebe returns to her step-father's Doggy Daycare to avoid her mother's disappointment for a few hours longer. Instead, her step-father hatches a plan to hide Florence with the dogs while they fake a successful summer camp.

Pharoh says "I used to work at the embassy" but never says which one. Hint that he used to be a spy.

# Intro

Florence shows up at Dogsome Daycare after getting kicked out of Summer Camp for !!reason!!.

Her stepdad, Pharoh, brings her inside quickly, then peaks through the window to see if anyone might have seen her from across the parking lot at the Consulate of Guatemala, where Stacey, Pharoh's wife and Florence's mother, works.

Florence is wary: she expects both Pharoh and Stacey to be mad that she got kicked out, but Pharoh seems....accomodating?

She learns that Pharoh promised Stacey this summer camp would be good for Florence, that she'd come back with a great report card "worthy of the fridge."

"Well, she's going to flip when she sees this." Florence slides her report card -- along with a note explaining why she was kicked out -- onto the table.

Pharoh ignores the note and scans the report card.



<!-- Lampshare the 'dog ate homework' cliche by having Pharoh feed documents to his 'Shredder' -->
> Why don't you use a shredder?

> I am -- this here is Shredder. Isn't that right? Aren't you my big shredder pup?

> Her name is Snowball!

> Not to me.
