From [the nycmidnight website](https://www.nycmidnight.com/genres)

A frightening story premised on the possibility of ghosts, which may appear by their own volition or through summoning by magic. Ghost stories are usually scary, leveraging suspense, a sense of the uncanny, and supernatural occurrences to elicit feelings of fear and foreboding. Ghosts appear in literature as early as Homer’s Odyssey, which chronicles the hero encountering spirits of the dead during a journey to the underworld. 

Common elements: *hauntings*, *supernatural intervention*, *chilling and suspenseful atmospheres*. Ghost story books include Alvin Schwartz’s Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark and Stephen King’s Doctor Sleep. Ghost story films include The Shining (1980) and The Sixth Sense (1999).


## Brain dump

hauntings, supernatural intervention.

Grandma (ghost) takes off an earring. Grown daughter  (son?) puts earring on. Warm story of remembrance for the deceased. Twist, adult child is possessed by deceased ancestor, who has been alive for centuries. 
- if grandma, then skipping a generation.  Mother's generation is 'the lucky one'?
- "mother always seemed distant" -- she knew her child would be possessed by grandma / ancestor
	+ parent had obligation to grandparent to have child to posess
- the past never dies?
- worried that she is forgetting her grandma (who cared for her when mother would not) adult is putting on earrings in an effort to remember more of her grandmother,

ghost takes off person's earring
- I used to live here.

A person realizes that _they_ are the ghost posessing another person, injected via devious experiment
- feeling like 'body is not my own'
- violation of self (for ghost _and_ person posessed)
- taking off an earring I don't remember getting my ears pierced
- this body is all that keeps me from the consuming void. Can I bear to say?

A haunted doll removes its earring, offering it to scared person w/o pierced ears. Accept and  pierce or reject and run?

## Structure for Amber Eyes
I: Worried that I'm losing memory of my grandmother
D: Mother treated me like an obligation, but not to my father
T: Grandmother takes off earrings for the last time. This body is all but used up. Time for the next.
R: Child puts on earrrings. Dies. Grandmother looks out at the world through her new eyes.

## Draft: Amber Eyes
Doting amber eyes, all I remember about Grandma Florence. I search old boxes for lost recollection. To Mother, I was an obligation, but Grandma cared. Her memory deserves dignity.

Inside the next bin, a black box, a gift from my mother that I ignored, too proud to miss Grandma. Immaculate silver bands encircle crescents within.

Florence looked through clouded amber eyes. Time to go. Removing the moon earrings, she filled the black box, sealed it as before, then laid down and died.

I smile at the mirror, at crescent moon earrings under lustrous hair. Best of all, young amber eyes.

## Structure for Staying Put
I: Despite their reassurance, I'm convinced this body is not mine
D: I take off earrings once again, uneasy every time. I don't remember piercing my ears.
T: A memory, not mine: bound to a chair, glass jars and electricity, plasma and pain. A mind is squeezed in, squeezing out my own.
R: I look at their hands, their hair, their skin. I am free to leave this body behind. This vessel keeping me safe from the consuming void.
