## Ágdá
What have the adults failed to teach you?
Is your voice heard? And when is it listened to?

### Character Profile
My name is Ágdá (`/ˈɑgdɑ/`) (she/her).

I'm human, and when you first see me you'll probably notice my molt scars, proud colors (yellow with black spots), and chatty attitude.

I wear thrifted hand-me-downs, a mess of pins, and always carry a canvas bag of spray paint.

As much of a pain it is to go to school, I'm always excited to learn about void construction but hate history, even though I wish I could just be finding new tagging spots. After school, you can usually find me hanging out with my friends exploring restricted sections or at my part time job as a line cook at the On-Planet Diner.

I consider myself insightful and persistent, but all the adults tell me to be more patient.

When can I just be myself?

I don't know it yet, but I'm on my way to becoming a Signal -- a passtionate, agenda-driven individual who works hard to create political change aboard the station.
