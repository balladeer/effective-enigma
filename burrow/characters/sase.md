- gray eyes

What have the adults failed to teach you?
Is your voice heard? And when is it listened to?


### Character Profile
My name is Sase(`/ˈsæsɛ/`) (he/him).

I'm Kihǔ, and when you first see me you'll probably notice my imposing size (for a Kihǔ), molting scales, and disinterested stance.

I wear a brand-name shirt, torn pants, and always carry my heavily-stickered hoverboard.

As much of a pain it is to go to school, I'm always excited to learn about microbioprogramming but hate station civics, even though I wish I could just be practicing tricks. After school, you can usually find me hanging out with my friends exploring restricted sections or at my part time job as a cashier at The Hungry Ape.

I consider myself brilliant and confident, but all the adults tell me to be more respectable.

When can I just be myself?

* Doiay: my try-hard, obnoxious coworker.

### Insights

## Ágdá - Teen 2
What have the adults failed to teach you?
Is your voice heard? And when is it listened to?
How will your growing powers shape you?


### Character Profile
My name is Ágdá (`/ˈɑgdɑ/`) (she/her).

I'm human, and when you first see me you'll probably notice my molt scars, proud colors (yellow with black spots), and chatty attitude.

I wear thrifted hand-me-downs, a mess of pins, and always carry a canvas bag of spray paint.

As much of a pain it is to go to school, I'm always excited to learn about void construction but hate history, even though I wish I could just be finding new tagging spots. After school, you can usually find me hanging out with my friends exploring restricted sections or at my part time job as a line cook at the On-Planet Diner.

I consider myself insightful and persistent, but all the adults tell me to be more patient.

When can I just be myself?
