What have the adults failed to teach you?
Is your voice heard? And when is it listened to?


### Character Profile
My name is Sase(`/ˈsæsɛ/`) (he/him).

I'm Kihû, and when you first see me you'll probably notice my imposing size (for a Kihû), molting scales, and disinterested stance.

I wear a long-sleeved shirt (to cover my molt), torn pants, and always carry my heavily-stickered hoverboard.

As much of a pain it is to go to school, I'm always excited to learn about microbioprogramming but hate station civics, even though I wish I could just be practicing tricks. After school, you can usually find me hanging out with my friends exploring restricted sections or at my part time job as a cashier at The Hungry Human.

I consider myself brilliant and confident, but all the adults tell me to be more respectable.

When can I just be myself?

I don't know it yet, but I'm on my way to becoming a Wrench -- a pragmratic individual who cares for the station, in all its idiosynchracies.
