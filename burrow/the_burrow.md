# Dread Machine submission

The goal of this file is to write a short story to submit to [The Dread Machine](https://www.thedreadmachine.com/submit/)

- up to 5000 words

Idea: Teens on a neutral space ship. They're hanging out, exploring whatever. They come across agents aligned to The War and, after being discovered, escape into the deeper parts of the space station. (Where they discover great and terrible self-defense / self-destruct mechanisms). They return to the space station proper, worried that they'll be recognized, suspicious that any person they see could be bringing the War closer.
(Orbital RPG)

## Story Craft

1. Intro: Ominous (Soldiers / Shipyard)
2. Dev: 
	- Refuge: community
	- Innocuous: restricted areas
3. Twist: Void (Restricted areas + spies)
4. Reconcile: Ominous (community)

Two teens navigate life on an ancient space station.

Exploring the restricted sectors provides an escape from the mass of visiting soldiers.

(Twist)?
- chase the painted signs of the spies thinking they are a 'geocache'-like puzzle left by earlier inhabitants
- they find a stash / hidden cache of spy-related stuff -- run (but don't see) one of the spies

The soldiers, with their bright colors and loud words, are not the only vector for the War to infect the Burrow.

Characters are pangolin / reptilian aliens, half the size of humans.

- Oh neat, we're on a space station, cozy and neutral. Neutrality brings safety, normalcy, and community.

- Oh no, neutrality is threatened, Sase is powerless to avoid it.
