# Major characters

## The Teen (1)
What have the adults failed to teach you?
Is your voice heard? And when is it listened to?
How will your growing powers shape you?


### Character Profile
My name is |name| (he/him).

I'm human, and when you first see me you'll probably notice my dyed hair, lanky appendages, and disinterested stance.

I wear a brand-name shirt, torn pants, and alwasys carry my heavily-stickered hoverboard.

As much of a pain it is to go to school, I'm always excited to learn about microbioprogramming but hate station civics, even though I wish I could just be practicing tricks. After school, you can usually find me hanging out with my friends exploring restricted sections or at my part time job as a cashier at The Angry Ape.

I consider myself brilliant and confident, but all the adults tell me to be more respectable.

When can I just be myself?

### Connections

* My try-hard, obnoxious coworker

### Insights

After school, you can usually find me hanging out with my friends exploring restricted sections or at my part time job as a line cook at the On-Planet Diner.

I consider myself insightful and persistent, but all the adults tell me to be more patient.
