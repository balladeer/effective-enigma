# The Station

Starting truth for the station:

- We are a neutral station, widely recognised as unaffiliated with either side of the ongoing war.
- The station is much older than our little community and much of it is unexplored.
- We have sufficient resources to ensure we meet all our residents’ basic needs.
- We celebrate and value difference in many forms, both personal and cultural.
- We operate open borders, accepting new arrivals with compassion and providing for them as equal residents.
- The world outside is hostile and treacherous, so we avoid leaving our station wherever possible.

## Look and Feel

### Aesthetic Touchstones

- Rough stone and rusted steel
- Metal grating
- Hexagonal blastdoors

### Rough shape and scale

Termites in a broken moon.
An approximate cylinder, half the size of Luna.

### Things we Found

- Defunct corporate branding
- Bioluminescence

### Marks we Made

- Community gardens
- Painted routes

## Threats

Rowdy soldiers from both sides of the war have taken shore leave here
(they are obviously not of the station, which gives protags normalcy. Broken when they learn there are soldiers they can not identify)

(This is a short story, so I'll leave it at one threat)
