# The Station
Starting truth for the station:

- We are a neutral station, widely recognised as unaffiliated with either side of the ongoing war.
- The station is much older than our little community and much of it is unexplored.
- We have sufficient resources to ensure we meet all our residents’ basic needs.
- We celebrate and value difference in many forms, both personal and cultural.
- We operate open borders, accepting new arrivals with compassion and providing for them as equal residents.
- The world outside is hostile and treacherous, so we avoid leaving our station wherever possible.

## Look and Feel
### Aesthetic Touchstones
Rough stone and rusted steel
Metal grating
Hexagonal blastdoors

#### Rough shape and scale
An approximate cylinder, half the size of Luna. Termites in a broken moon.

### Things we Found
Defunct corporate branding
Bioluminescence

### Marks we Made
Community gardens
Painted routes

## Threats
Rowdy soldiers from both sides of the war have taken shore leave here
(they are obviously not of the station, which gives protags normalcy. Broken when they learn there are soldiers they can not identify)

(This is a short story, so I'll leave it at one threat)

# Aspects

## The Interstellar War.
An all-consuming conflict, burning across the stars.

The *two sides*
1. The republic
2. The union
Which came first is forgotten.

Their differences
1. The colors they wear
2. Their interpretation of the texts

## The Station Itself.
The systems, mundane and uncanny, keeping us alive.

Assistant's name: ABENA
(Kihǔ all say 'ADENA')

Directives
1. Protect that which grows within
2. Prepare for the return of the makers

## The Markets.
The ways we trade for resources on this station.

The *outside investor*: Fee-Nix
Their intentions
1. Make us a tourist destination
2. Offer conditional safety

## The Scum and Villainy.
The smugglers, gangsters & thieves haunting our station.

The two major gangs
1. The Half-Coins (reckless)
2. The Kutpit Family (ambitious)

## The Unaffiliated.
The families, workers & refugees making up our diverse society

An upcoming event: Lilac Festival (when the station's bioluminescence turns purple for three nights)

Naming system: haphazard and unplanned

## The Lambent Strand.
A glowing thread, weaving every life together into a great tapestry.

Also called _the current_ or _the clearing_.

Two ways we see it:
1. a holistic energy
2. smoke and mirrors
