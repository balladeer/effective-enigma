# Notes from Feb 28 Critique

Favorite poetic device

- careful repetition

## JD: Farewell to Rusalka
### Summary
- Ivan: grows up, becomes an altar boy
- Falls in love w/ priest's ward (later, his daughter)
- There's a festival, where village ritualistically chases water spirits out of their fields
- Ivan finds deacon drowned on dry ground
	+ doesn't know what the deal is
- Priest says, "don't worry, I know it's not you"
- Ivan goes to bath, bumps into another murder: bath-spirit that he didn't know existed, who was drowned
- Piece of priest's clothes, thinks Priest drowned him
- Priest genuinely confused
- concludes the Rusalka are real and murderous
- follows procession to help
- 'attack' on procession fizzles, he watches and tries to figure out what happened
- Figures out Roza is a  Rusalka right as she asks if she's figured it out
- Roza tells her side of the story
- Priest wants to let her go back to the water
- Ivan is chill, and won't turn her in

### Zach:
- Ivan does a lot of hard-core rationalizing while lightly drunk
- Break up the expository lump of Roza's monologue
- No sense that Ivan saw anything unusual when he burned Roza's sleeve (at the time, or when Roza said 'thanks for not flinching')
	+ layering in more info about Ivan would help break things up
- Reveal that Roza was priest's daughter was sudden and inconsequential
- Unclear on the timing of the procession: Ivan spends hours after it hanging out --- isn't it late?
- I see you worked graminivorous

## ZC: Burrow

### Summary
- Sase lives on a space-station / asteroid
- Sase is not human - is  Kihû
	+ Lots of things built with humans in mind
- Sase works on a shipyard cafeteria for refueling or trading
- Dead-end job
- Serves soldiers in a designated neutral zone
- Sase uses fight as excuse to dip out of shift

- Sase's goal: explore the ancient tunnels / corridors
- A lot of the station not adapted to his height
- Meets up with Ágdá, a more creative type
- They go off to explore forbidden tunnels
- See signs of people in places no one should be
- They see a locked door with symbols they don't understand
	+ analog lock instead of digital
- They go through vents
- Entering, it appears to be a planning place for the war
- They attempt to leave when they detect others coming when detecing others w/ their bio-electric fields
- They make it into the vents
- Humans + their teacher arrive
- Spies are here -- shocks Sase
- They half get discovered, their teacher pretends not to have found them; let's them go
- they leave without getting detected
- Their worldview is shattered: the War involves their staiton now

### General discussion
Pepper:
- First line works great, contrasts the last line well
	+ Could just keep it playing on a loop
- Really interesting
- Lots of great worldbuilding
- Prose is fantastic -- paragraphs and sentence to sentence flow nicely
	+ pleasant to read from prose standpoint
	+ Had enough style without getting in the way
- Trip ups
	+ Dialog:
		* prose flows so well that dialogue felt clunkier than prose
		* had a hard time figuring out
- kept having questions: what's the thing with these armies, is it something else? What's the most important thing at any given time?
- How old is the protagonist? Took a while to figure out he wasn't human
	+ 3 pages down...might be too late
- Where to cut
	+ The first section sets the tone, but doens't quite get to the plot as much as 
	+ Sase attempting to get into the Burrow and work with the hoverboard works well
	+ If you're looking to cut down on words, everything before 'hoverboard + stool' will do
	+ Maybe start with 'soldiers arguing in background', ditch the noodle stand.
- Lots of questions raised
	+ What's Fee-Nix?
	+ What's Republic vs. Union?
	+ None of the large questions get answered.
		* They're not important to the protags journey
		* Try cutting back on some of this world-building.
- More attention to dialogue.

- Ending sentence was ominous, good job.

Andrew
- Read fast.
- First scene is the first place to cut things down.
	+ Just chop off everything before the second food rush.
		* Good scene settign w/ follow-up (e.g. the motto)
	+ Hoverboard scene works well
	+ "It's a good first scene to a different story."
- Events of the story were pretty clear
- Really likes the vibe of pervasive bioluminescence
- Wasn't sure what impact I wanted with the ending
	+ Ending fell a bit flat.
- Was really expecting the mystery of what Kaysh was doing to be answered
	+ If you want mystery to be the payoff, setup the beginning differently
	+ Made it feel like the first chapter of a novel
- Bioelectric sence caught him off guard
	+ blue-light electric didn't quite foreshadow the bioelectricity well
	+ talking about background electricty was cool

James
- Looking to cut stuff? First scene.
	+ It's a great first scene, but the majority of it led to different expectations
		* If the story was about 'working in a cafeteria at teh crossroad of the galaxy'
- Less building the cafeteria, more moving on
- James appreciated the vagueness around the war and the two armies.
	+ The was doesn't affect Sase, so he isn't interested
	+ This worked for James
	+ Makes the ending, `this has to matter`, to work better
	+ Would like this ending to sit a little longer, sit with Sase a bit more
	+ could really up the ominous bit of the ending
- Dialogue could use some tuning.
	+ Felt younger than the story that played out
- Emotional reponse
	+ wonder and adventure at the world, very quickly
		* bioluminescence done well
			- seen it done, but not in this way
			- they found it, carry it with them, etc
			- gives a sense of adapability to the world they live on
			- "don't do anything to diminsh those elements"
			- if there are small ways to amp it up, do it

JD
- most of what he had has been covered
- a thing that stood out
	+ Sase's goal was hard to get early on
		* wasn't until we got to the Burrow that we got a protag who was interested in doing anything
		* we saw a lot of a beautiful world...but wasn't sure why
	+ characters are discovering that the war is important to them
		* give them a want to have before this realization
- where he thought it was going: love story w/ Ágdá?
- make Sase's goal more explicit so it can be rooted for the whole time
- Some trouble picking an age range, given they aren't human
	+ they can work, get detention
	+ opening feels like 'dead-end job, I should do more'
	+ juxtapose's with "I'm still in school"
- Wanted to 'be in' the scene with Ágdá artwork
- hoverboard was cool: I wanted kick-flips!
- did seem like the first chapter of a novel
	+ could go any way


### Author questions
- was anything cozy?
	+ if so, was that coziness threatened?
- Shipyard vs. Burrow
	+ Pepper: noticed, but not the focus, so didn't have much impact
	+ Andrew: could have been overplayed
		* focus of Sase's second scene was the difference of 'over-sanitized hell-scape' vs. 'grungy rock, but home'
	+ James:
		* different aesthetic vibes clearly
		* brilliance of the hoverboard: it feels like their lives have become regimented by the AI system
		* being deep enough in the burow that the AI can't detect them gives a corporate, overlord-sponsored mining colony
	+ 

Dialogue felt younger than expected:
- how young did it make them feel?
	+ Pepper: 23(ish), could be 25
	+ Andrew: 15-17
	+ JD: 'high school'
	+ James: at times, 13-14, others, 16-17
		* sense of wanting to explore: 13-14
		* sense of monotony: 16-17
