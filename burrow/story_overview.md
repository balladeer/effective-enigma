# Story overview

# 01. Introduction 
%% Dynamite Proactive

## Scene Goal
Goal: leave Shipyard.
Sase finishes a shift at the Hungry Ape.
His goal is to be comfortable. Normal is hanging out w/ Ágdá. He wants to feel normal.

In a big cafeteria near the shipyards

## Crucible
- He dislikes being so near all of the visiting soldiers: they wear bright clothing, speak loudly, and carry themselves with energy.
- This was supposed to be a slow shift, but he didn't know so many soldiers were 
- He dislikes the harsh electric lights they use here in the shipyard (preferring the bioluminescence of his home deeper in)
- His voice is not heard:
	+ Regular customers don't listen to him, much less Soldiers
	+ Doiay treats Sase's worries as laziness
- Doiay's try-hard ambitions put extra work / take time from Sase

## Victory

- When a small scuffle starts among some soldiers, he convinces Doiay to take the counter, then sneaks out the back.
	- scuffle, like the War, isn't Sase's problem

# 02. Development
%% Kishōtenketsu
## Introduction
Goal: Find Ágdá
Sase looks for Agda. He leaves the shipyard, anxious to get back to the darker, rockier, goopier interior of the Burrow.

Adena (Abena?) prevents Sase's access for a few minutes, not recognizing his handprint for a few attempts. He has to reach high up because Kihǔ are half the height of the humans that presumably built this place.

Bioluminescent lights offer a diffuse glow. Metal grates, rusted yet stable, interrupt narrow hallways carved through rough stone.

## Development
He passes into a large cavern. Darkness hides details, but the dim is safe, normal. 

Dim paths, marked by paint, guide those  who know through the haphazardly named neighborhoods.

He passes the school, a converted warehouse/laboratory, where Kaysh, Sase's microbioprogramming teacher let him off hook for 

He crosses through the community gardens: sources of nutrients and flavors beyond the nutrient goop that the station grows. Some visitors think the goops are novel delicacies, but to Sase, they are just the common, boring food.

## Twist
He meets Ágdá.
Goal: find a place to spend time with Ágdá - she paints, he boards.

They pass into a restricted zone (reader: oh no!)...

## Reconciliation
but it is clear they do this regularly: Sase to hang out and board, Ágdá to tag or explore.

They discuss teenage issues:
- They both have an obnoxious co-worker
- They like and dislike subjects at school
- Ágdá wants to build, make, do, while Sase wants to be.
- Sase might have feelings for Ágdá, but Ágdá has a crush on Hyok.

# 03. Twist
%% Dynamite Proactive
## Scene Goal
They discover some moved debris, recognizing it because they spend time exploring these forbidden halls.

(Mini-reactive)
- Reaction: worry -- something's down here?
- Dillema: leave, follow, or explore elsewhere?
	+ station drones would have cleaned -- it's something else
	+ leave -- whoever it is might catch us (so what -- they shouldn't be here either)
	+ explore elsewhere? (most of the station is boring -- take opportunities when you can)
	+ explore (Sase gets to stay with Ágdá)

New goal: who or what moved the debris?


## Crucible
Following the trail, they discover a locked door, but use their small size to squeeze through vents into the room beyond. There they find a cache of supplies and signs. 

## Setback
They don't know which side of the War this belongs to, but it is clearly one of them.

TODO: what happens? does someone arrive (Teacher, perhaps?) Does an alarm go off?

%% What are they planning to use the station for?
- produce chemicals, food, supplies (using the goop?) for the War
- convince / convert Adena to their side of the War
- spy on the station and its visitors, sending information to the War
- take over the station from the inside
- smuggle people to the War
- smuggle weapons to the War
- prepare the station for a hostile attack

### What evidence could they find?
- documents
	+ why would the spies store documents here? Maybe they think it remote / secure enough that they're willing to do admin outside their heads
	+ maybe they want to avoid being caught with documents on them
- in-progress manufacturing
	+ Sase could use biomicroprogramming knowledge to at least realize the stuff getting made is dangerous
- equipment - receivers, antennae
	+ make it obvious that recordings are being made and stored here
- maps, plans, analog stuff
	+ Make it clear the spies are avoiding Adena by going analog
		* wouldn't matter unless spies were planning to operate in the Shipyard, where Adena is still in full operation
	+ Could make the writing illegible, but maps are harder to disguise: teens know that something is going on with the shipyard and Burrow, but can't read what.
	+ By leaving the maps disturbed (in a rush to avoid getting seen), the teens realize the spies will switch locations, meaning even if their voices were heard, the spies would be gone by the time the teens could get anyone with power back here.
		* Ágdá can recognize the script of the War, confirms that the authors are deliberately using code on the maps

Looking for an option that most aligns with a 'loss of innocence' 
"They figured out how to get past Adena! We need to warn--"
"Sase, wait! Wait. What if Adena let them through? What if all this was created by--"
"--Burrowers"

# 04. Reconciliation
%% Dynamite Reactive

Sase returns to the community gardens. No one is following him.

React: scared, worried
Dilemma: go back?
Decision: look for Ágdá in community

NEW GOAL: find the familiar, the normal
He looks for a while, but does not find Ágdá. He sees War behind the eyes of everyone he meets.

Sase returns to the Shipyard and sits in a corner of the cafeteria. He stays there, watching soldiers. At least here, the War is obvious.
