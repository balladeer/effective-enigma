# Story overview
_OneSentence_: An alien teenager learns that the space station he lives on is not safe from the machinations of the War that looms constant over the galaxy.
----

# 01. Introduction 
%% Dynamite Proactive

_OneSentence_: Sase finishes a shift at his new job while the reader learns about the War and this station's brittle neutrality.

## Scene Goal
*Goal*: escape the discomfort of the Shipyard

Sase finishes a shift at the Hungry Ape. His goal is to be comfortable: normal is hanging out w/ Ágdá. 

## Crucible
- He dislikes being so near all of the visiting soldiers: they wear bright clothing, speak loudly, and carry themselves with energy beyond his comfort.
- This was supposed to be a slow shift, but he didn't know so many soldiers had arrived
- He dislikes the harsh electric lights they use here in the shipyard (preferring the bioluminescence of his home inside the moon-mined rock)
- His voice is not heard:
	+ Regular customers don't listen to him, much less Soldiers
	+ Doiay treats Sase's worries as laziness
- Doiay's try-hard ambitions put extra work / take time from Sase

## Victory
- When a small scuffle starts among some soldiers, he convinces Doiay to take the counter, then sneaks out the back.
	- scuffle, like the War, isn't Sase's problem

# 02. Development
%% Kishōtenketsu

_OneSentence_: Sase searches for his friend Ágdá while the reader learns about the major sections of the space station, the communities that grow organically inside the Burrow's moon-mined mass, and the vastness of the uncontrolled Core.


## Introduction
*Goal*: Find Ágdá
Sase looks for Agda. He leaves the shipyard, anxious to get back to the darker, rockier, goopier interior of the Burrow.

Adena prevents Sase's access for a few minutes, not recognizing his handprint for a few attempts. He has to reach high up because Kihǔ are half the height of the humans that presumably built this place.

Bioluminescent lights offer a diffuse glow. Metal grates, rusted yet stable, interrupt narrow hallways carved through rough stone.

## Development
He passes into a large cavern. Darkness hides details, but the dim is safe, normal. 

Dim paths, marked by paint, guide those  who know through the haphazardly named neighborhoods.

He passes the school, a converted warehouse/laboratory, where Kaysh, Sase's microbioprogramming teacher should be administering detention. 

He crosses through the community gardens: sources of nutrients and flavors beyond the nutrient goop that the station grows. Some visitors think the goops are novel delicacies, but to Sase, they are just the common, boring food.

## Twist
He meets Ágdá.
*Goal*: find a place to spend time with Ágdá - she paints, he boards.

They pass into a restricted zone (reader: oh no!)...

## Reconciliation
...but it is clear they do this regularly: Sase to hang out and board, Ágdá to tag or explore.

They discuss teenage issues:
- They both have an obnoxious co-worker
- They like and dislike subjects at school
- Ágdá wants to build, make, do, while Sase wants to be.
- Sase might have feelings for Ágdá, but Ágdá has a crush on Hyok.
- Ágdá asks why Kaysh let Sase skip detention. Sase responds that their teacher goes easy on Sase often, probably because Sase likes Kaysh's class on microbioprogramming.

# 03. Twist
%% Kishōtenketsu
_OneSentence_: The teens discover the office of some spies deep within the Burrow.

They discover some moved debris, recognizing it because they spend time exploring these forbidden halls.

## Mini-reactive
- Reaction: worry -- something's down here?
- Dillema: leave, follow, or explore elsewhere?
	+ station drones would have cleaned -- it's something else
	+ leave -- whoever it is might catch us (so what -- they shouldn't be here either)
	+ explore elsewhere? (most of the station is boring -- take opportunities when you can)
	+ explore (Sase gets to stay with Ágdá)


%% Dynamite Proactive
## Scene Goal
*New goal*: discover who or what moved the debris?

## Crucible
Following the trail, they discover a door with an analog lock (instead of Adena-controlled digital), but use their small size to squeeze through vents into the room beyond. There they find a makeshift office, with maps. 

They don't know which side of the War this belongs to, but it is clearly one of them.

%% What are they planning to use the station for?
- produce chemicals, food, supplies (using the goop?) for the War

They find maps, papers, and other non-digital documents.

- maps, plans, analog stuff
	+ Make it clear the spies are avoiding Adena by going analog
		* wouldn't matter unless spies were planning to operate in the Shipyard, where Adena is still in full operation
	+ Could make the writing illegible, but maps are harder to disguise: teens know that something is going on with the shipyard and Burrow, but can't read what.
		* Ágdá can recognize the script of the War, confirms that the authors are deliberately using code on the maps
	+ By leaving the maps disturbed (in a rush to avoid getting seen), the teens realize the spies will switch locations, meaning even if their voices were heard, the spies would be gone by the time the teens could get anyone with power back here.
	+ This option results in "I know there are spies, but I don't know who they are, who they work for, or what they are doing" which should give Sase plenty of reason to be paranoid.

Looking for an option that most aligns with a 'loss of innocence' 
"They figured out how to get past Adena! We need to warn--"
"Sase, wait! Wait. What if Adena let them through? What if all this was created by--"
"--Burrowers"

## Setback
They hear someone coming. They scramble to put away anything they touched, and scramble back into the vents. Given how noisy the vents were climbing in, they hide in place.

They hear multiple voices from below. The vent grate opens, and a bright light shines in Sase's face, who shuts his eyes (recall the bright lights from the Shipyard irritating him).

The light retreats and Sase hears Kaysh's voice saying "nothing up here." Sase opens his eyes to see Kaysh looking at him, worry in his eyes. He mouths "wait, then go" before retreating back down.

The teens wait for an hour or two while the office is emptied. When they emerge, the office is empty -- even the analog lock is gone, leaving the door ajar.

IDEA: teacher lets Sase out of detention early. Reader's realize it is because teacher is caught up in spy stuff.

# 04. Reconciliation
%% Dynamite Reactive

_OneSentence_: Sase, sensing a growing paranoia within himself, heads to the Shipyard, prefering known danger to unknown danger.

Sase returns to the community gardens. No one is following him.

React: scared, worried
Dilemma: go back?
Decision: look for Ágdá in community

*New Goal*: find the familiar, the normal
He looks for a while, but does not find Ágdá. He sees War behind the eyes of everyone he meets.

Sase returns to the Shipyard and sits in a corner of the cafeteria. He stays there, watching soldiers. At least here, the War is obvious.
