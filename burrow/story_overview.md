# Story overview

# 01. Introduction 
%% Dynamite Proactive

## Scene Goal
Sase finishes a shift at the Hungry Ape.
His goal is to be comfortable. Normal is hanging out w/ Ágdá. He wants to feel normal.

In a big cafeteria near the shipyards

## Crucible
- He dislikes being so near all of the visiting soldiers: they wear bright clothing, speak loudly, and carry themselves with energy.
- This was supposed to be a slow shift, but he didn't know so many soldiers were 
- He dislikes the harsh electric lights they use here in the shipyard (preferring the bioluminescence of his home deeper in)
- His voice is not heard:
	+ Regular customers don't listen to him, much less Soldiers
	+ Doiay treats Sase's worries as laziness
- Doiay's try-hard ambitions put extra work / take time from Sase

## Victory

- When a small scuffle starts among some soldiers, he convinces Doiay to take the counter, then sneaks out the back.
	- scuffle, like the War, isn't Sase's problem

# 02. Development
%% Kishōtenketsu
## Introduction
Sase looks for Agda. He leaves the shipyard, anxious to get back to the darker, rockier, goopier interior of the Burrow.

Adena (Abena?) prevents Sase's access for a few minutes, not recognizing his handprint for a few attempts.

Bioluminescent lights offer a diffuse glow. Metal grates, rusted yet stable, interrupt narrow hallways carved through rough stone.

## Development
He passes into a large cavern. Darkness hides details, but the dim is safe, normal. 

Dim paths, marked by paint, guide those  who know through the haphazardly named neighborhoods.

He passes the school, a converted warehouse/laboratory, where Kaysh, Sase's microbioprogramming teacher let him off hook for 

He crosses through the community gardens: sources of nutrients and flavors beyond the nutrient goop that the station grows. Some visitors think the goops are novel delicacies, but to Sase, they are just the common, boring food.

## Twist
He meets Ágdá 

## Reconciliation
Sase returns to the community gardens. No one is following him. He looks for a while, but does not find Ágdá. He sees War behind the eyes of everyone he meets.

Sase returns to the Shipyard and sits in a corner of the cafeteria. He stays there, watching soldiers. At least here, the War is obvious.
