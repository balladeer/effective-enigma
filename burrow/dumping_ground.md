## Idea dump

Teens running from robotic dogs. Hiding under an overpass or LA River canals. One character thinks they are safe (refuge), the other doesn't (Ominous). Why the different? What do we learn about the second character?

Teens doing something (future drugs / consumption) that the robots should ignore (show familiarity, demonstrate a reader-strange normalcy from characters). Character brings something unexpected to the group, which increased perceived danger.

## Dump from 'story overview'
%% What are they planning to use the station for?
- produce chemicals, food, supplies (using the goop?) for the War
- convince / convert Adena to their side of the War
- spy on the station and its visitors, sending information to the War
- take over the station from the inside
- smuggle people to the War
- smuggle weapons to the War
- prepare the station for a hostile attack


### What evidence could they find?
- documents
    + why would the spies store documents here? Maybe they think it remote / secure enough that they're willing to do admin outside their heads
    + maybe they want to avoid being caught with documents on them
- in-progress manufacturing
    + Sase could use biomicroprogramming knowledge to at least realize the stuff getting made is dangerous
- equipment - receivers, antennae
    + make it obvious that recordings are being made and stored here
