## Idea dump

Teens running from robotic dogs. Hiding under an overpass or LA River canals. One character thinks they are safe (refuge), the other doesn't (Ominous). Why the different? What do we learn about the second character?

Teens doing something (future drugs / consumption) that the robots should ignore (show familiarity, demonstrate a reader-strange normalcy from characters). Character brings something unexpected to the group, which increased perceived danger.
