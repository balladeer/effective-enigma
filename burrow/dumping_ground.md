## Idea dump

Teens running from robotic dogs. Hiding under an overpass or LA River canals. One character thinks they are safe (refuge), the other doesn't (Ominous). Why the different? What do we learn about the second character?

Teens doing something (future drugs / consumption) that the robots should ignore (show familiarity, demonstrate a reader-strange normalcy from characters). Character brings something unexpected to the group, which increased perceived danger.

## Dump from 'story overview'
%% What are they planning to use the station for?
- produce chemicals, food, supplies (using the goop?) for the War
- convince / convert Adena to their side of the War
- spy on the station and its visitors, sending information to the War
- take over the station from the inside
- smuggle people to the War
- smuggle weapons to the War
- prepare the station for a hostile attack


### What evidence could they find?
- documents
    + why would the spies store documents here? Maybe they think it remote / secure enough that they're willing to do admin outside their heads
    + maybe they want to avoid being caught with documents on them
- in-progress manufacturing
    + Sase could use biomicroprogramming knowledge to at least realize the stuff getting made is dangerous
- equipment - receivers, antennae
    + make it obvious that recordings are being made and stored here
    

# Early ideas
Idea: Teens on a neutral space ship. They're hanging out, exploring whatever. They come across agents aligned to The War and, after being discovered, escape into the deeper parts of the space station. (Where they discover great and terrible self-defense / self-destruct mechanisms). They return to the space station proper, worried that they'll be recognized, suspicious that any person they see could be bringing the War closer.
(Orbital RPG)

## Story Craft

1. Intro: Ominous (Soldiers / Shipyard)
2. Dev: 
    - Refuge: community
    - Innocuous: restricted areas
3. Twist: Void (Restricted areas + spies)
4. Reconcile: Ominous (community)

Two teens navigate life on an ancient space station.

Exploring the restricted sectors provides an escape from the mass of visiting soldiers.

(Twist)?
- chase the painted signs of the spies thinking they are a 'geocache'-like puzzle left by earlier inhabitants
- they find a stash / hidden cache of spy-related stuff -- run (but don't see) one of the spies

The soldiers, with their bright colors and loud words, are not the only vector for the War to infect the Burrow.



# Brainstorm a few structures

## Refuge, Innocuous, Void, Ominous
- Teens on the station.
- Teens exploring restricted areas.
- Teens find War-aligned cache and discover residents are hiding their support.
- Teens escape back to unrestricted areas, wary that anyone could War-aligned, a threat to station and home.

## Refuge, Ominous, Void, Innocuous
- Teens on the station.
- While exploring, discover War-aligned cache.
- Discovered, chased into station.
- Return to station, paranoid
