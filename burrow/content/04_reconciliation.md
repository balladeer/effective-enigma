I stood in Silo 3, outside the market where I shopped for food, where Ágdá's clutch-mate sold snacks and fuel and water.
My elbows dug at my sides as I glanced from person to person.
The weight of my backpack tugged at my shoulders; I kept shrugging to relieve the discomfort.

"Well, I uh---I need to head to work."
Ágdá looked past me as she spoke.

"Yeah, sure. See ya."
My eyes forgot about her as she turned to walk away.

All around me, people---my neighbors---talked and laughed and ate and walked.

I wandered slowly, listening to passing conversations.
Was that code for something?
Were they involved?
My right arm scratched and scratched at my molting scales, seeking relief it could not find.

The streaks of bioluminescence that gave Silo 3 its signature dim look shined in my eyes, brighter than usual, but I could not look away, could not miss anything.

Was that path marker always there?
Had I seen that face before?
Why was that group of people talking so quietly?

## Dillema

There were spies living here, living among us.

I should tell someone.
Anyone.
Everyone.

Should I tell the station---tell Adena there were spies in the Burrow? What if they found out?

*What if the station already knew?*

<!--
1. Go look for the the spies' trail?
2. Go find Kaysh?
3. Tell Adena
-->

## Decision

<!--
New Goal: Find the familiar, the normal
 -->

I made my way---one wary glance after another---back to the shuttle station and stepped onto the next shuttle that arrived.
Minutes later, I was being ferried across the Spine that connected the rocky Burrow to the Shipyard high above.
I stared out into the void of space, out toward the War.

The War was out there, everywhere out there.

*But it was here, too.*

I entered the Shipyard, with its wide, white halls, its blue ceramic ceilings, and its electric lights buzzing overhead, irritating my face and neck.

I wound my way to the cafeteria where I worked, this time entering as a customer. I found a dirty table in a corner and sat down, alone, my back to the wall.

Before me, a sea of blue clothes.
Light blue.
Dark blue.
Soldiers from the War, eating, laughing, boasting, being.

My heart raced inside tightening ribs.

*The War is here.*
