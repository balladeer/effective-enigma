## Scene Goal
"Welcome to station ISSI-4. Please enjoy our peace in peace."

The intercom's clawingly clear tones echoed off the ceramic-steel of the cafeteria's walls and ceiling before absorbing into the mass of blue-hued clothing arrayed out in front of me, visitors to my home, customers for my boss. Soldiers.

I sat in the corner of the stall, next to the refrigerator and below the racks of human-sized cutlery. The lights--bright, white, and _electric_--dimmed just enough to dull their edge.

I rubbed my left sleeve with my other hand, the pressure and friction providing a shot of relief for the molting scales underneath. For the first time since starting here, I was glad that the station's health code allowed long-sleeved uniforms.

A counter filled with trays of still-warm food behind glass windows spearated me from the visitors packing the tables in the center of the circular room. The station welcomes visitors and new arrivals all the time, but I had never seen so many soldiers from both sides of the war visit at once.

A typical day would see a few dozen people eating during this hour, but now the tables were filled with blue. Light blue pants here, dark blue over there. I wasn't even sure which side was which. So long as their arguments did not escalate, the station did not care. Even if they did come to blows, _I_ would not care; their fight was not my fight.

I just wanted to finish this shift and get back inside the Burrow, away from here.

## Crucible
Many would-be customers passed by, glancing at the food on display just long enough to decide that their hunger needed another cuisine. If Doiay were not so busy in the back, she would tell me to invite the passers-by over, offer them a sample, catch their interest and turn it into a sale.


Another blue-coat approached the stall. His tawny skin was not dissimilar to my own, though his hairy skin lacked the deep orange of my back scales. I put on a smile and kicked my stool over to the serving counter.

"Welcome to the Hungry Human, what can I get you?"

With the stool, I could reach all the food, though the man rose a good two heads taller than me.

"You have anything with rice or bread?"

_What else would this stall serve?_

"We've got fried rice and fried noodles. Synth-protein and insects costs extra, but the goop bar's included."

The man fished out some coins while I made his bowl. I fed them to the pay machine; when it failed to spit them back out, I handed over the food.

He carried his meal over to the goop--six bowls of Burrow-made nutrient pastes--and begin spooning a spoonful of each onto the side of his bowl. Next to neutrality, the Burrow's best known for its extensive microbe-farms.

"_Sase_, you're supposed to say 'Welcome to the Hungry Human. Come hungry, leave human'."

I finished marking transaction into the computer, using the time to steel myself, then stepped off my stool and turned toward my supervisor. Doiay and I were in the same grade, but like most humans, she was almost twice my height and had black hair. Hers reached past her shoulders, though she kept it wrapped up in a twist under her food net. 

Hair for her, scales for me: no one likes eating bits of the person who just served you.

"I know, I know," I said, shaking my head, "I just...why bother, you know? No one comes here for the service."

"Everyone comes here for the service."
