## Introduction

I wound my way through the narrow, bare hallways of the employees-only back-halls before sliding out through a subtle door into one of the Shipyard's public arteries and into the flow of people.
Again, the bold white-and-blue of the Shipyard's primary aesthetic glowed from every wall and ceiling, unwilling to be hidden by decades of dust.
At every corner and intersection, tiled into the floor and painted onto the walls, the solid-blue symbol of a human head, its only eye a white star, greeted me, a bit of corporate pageantry left over from the builders and miners that made the station.

My hoverboard bounced against my leg as I walked.
I eyed every nook and bench, but knew I wouldn't find a place to board here.
Some of the old merchants used to leave us alone, as long as we were quiet and customer traffic was light.
But now that the Fee-Nix company has injected a bunch of money into "revitalizing" the Shipyard, making it more tourist-friendly, there are Fee-Nix security guards, in their hideous black and green suites, patrolling every public space here.

Everything about the Shipyard moves toward lighter, cleaner, more controlled.

Sterile.

That's why I prefer my home, the Burrow.

Some folks think of it as 'going down' to the Burrow, others 'going over', 'going into', or 'going up'.
Direction is a funny thing on a space station.

Whatever the direction, I headed for the big hexagonal blast doors that marked the gate between the Shipyard's shining, branching, void-facing modules and the shuttle rail station that led to the excavated tunnels and chambers of the Burrow---a wandering moon, carved by the founders to extract materials long, long ago, maybe before the War.

The artery connected to a larger hallway, lifting the already tall ceiling several floors higher.
Shops lined the walls on every floor, but these shops preferred customers other than residents of the station, like me.
They sold trips to far-away systems and fancy drinks in fancy bottles.
Flashing lights and fancy signs teased money out of the pockets of visitors.

I followed my usual route, sticking near the outer edge of the hall with other Kihû and creatures of similar size, a convention that kept the faster people, like the humans, with their muscle-filled legs as tall as me, near the center of traffic, where they could speed by without disturbing the rest of us.

A few minutes later, I stood beneath the Gateway, a giant hexagon of old metal, three stories tall, that led to the rail station and material processing bays. Adena, the station's AI assistant, kept the door open, its black paneled border contrasting with the Shipyard's harsh brightness.

Strung across the hallway sat a trio of humanoid-sized checkpoints: chain-link fences with three controlled-entry doors installed and ribbon-cordoned lanes leading up to each, dividing people into two groups: visitors and residents. I stepped into the latter line.

Only residents could access the Burrow proper, and that's where I was headed, back to the comfortable gloom, to my hang out with my friend, Ágdá.
She should have finished her own shift a couple of hours ago. She had found a new way into the restricted tunnels a few days ago, and we had talked of exploring it in class every day since.

When my turn arrived, I approached the terminal, the only Kihû in the line of eight residents transiting back to the rocky Burrow.
Ahead of me, the gray metal door slid shut.
I looked around for the stool that Adena typically provided for us; taller beings than I had built the hand-print reader.

I stretched up on my hind toes and swiped my right hand at the sensor.

_Unable to read handprint. Please try again._

"Adena, where's the stool?"

From a pair of speakers on either side of the locked door, the station's response arrived, too loud and too bassy, as usual.

"I'm sorry, resident Sase; a Republic soldier took it."

*Which color was that again?* I looked around for people wearing blue of any hue.

"Well, can you just let me through, Adena?" I asked, reaching out to the door with my free hand.

The door flashed red.

"All persons passing through the gate must validate their status."

"Yeah, yeah, I know."

_Stupid station._

I glanced around.
Seeing no Fee-Nix security nearby, and hearing the agitation of those waiting behind me, I dropped my board to the ground.
It activated mid-fall, a subtle red glow lit the ground as it hovered up a few inches, never contacting the tile floor.

I hopped on and, with a full body stretch upward, planted my hand on the waiting sensor, holding it there long enough to hear the lock disengage.
The door itself slid to the side as I stepped off my board.

"Welcome, Resident Sase."

I rolled my eyes as I kicked off, riding my hoverboard through the door toward the rail station.

## Development

****

Despite holding thousands of visitors at a time, the Shipyard's size was a rounding error compared to the volume of the Burrow it sprouted from.
Aboard one of Adena's rail shuttles, I sat with my back to the window, facing the floor.
If the bright electricity inside was bad, the silent void was worse.

The shuttle left the metal tube, traveling down an industrial rail that ran along the Shipyard's spine back to the rocky mass of the Burrow.
While children and the easily impressed looked out the windows, I preferred to keep my eyes on the floor.
There was nothing out there worth seeing.
*Nothing worth knowing.*

I held my egg tooth between three fingers, feeling its point dig into my skin. This part of my trip always felt longer than the clocks claimed.

Minutes later, the shuttle passed into the moon, leaving the void behind, then departed the main spine, which they said traveled deep into the core of the Burrow back when extraction still occurred, switching instead onto a smaller set of rails to make a trio of stops before returning to the Shipyard.
When the doors opened at my stop, I grabbed my pack and board, then hopped off the shuttle and left the station, exiting into a large, dim cavern, the storage cavity known as Silo 3.

*Home.*

Somewhere inside, Ágdá was waiting with a promise of hidden adventure.

My eyes adjusted and from the darkness arose familiar sights.
The rock walls that made up the boundaries of this place glimmered with wide washes of glowing bacterial colonies.
Their dim light carried in the humid air, giving the entire cave a subtle glow.
A streak of blue reflected off the buildings to my left.
Stripes of red and orange and purple made the puddles in the road ahead pop with joy.

The humidity opened my scales, relieving the itch of my molt; the tingles and prickles that the Shipyard's dry, processed air caused eased.

Dim paths, marked by glowing paint filled with microbes, guided those who knew through the haphazard streets.
Board underfoot, I pushed off, hovering along into the mist.

Colors turned to streaks as I followed well-known signs.
Two purple squares marked the way back to the school, an old warehouse laboratory that they'd turned into a school, dozens of clutches before I hatched.
I passed by with a wave, thankful that Teacher Kaysh---who was probably grateful to be home now that he had no one to keep in detention---had let me off the hook tonight.

<!-- TODO: how does Sase feel during all of this? -->

From there, I turned toward "blue square over green circle", a winding path leading down the curved edge of the cave toward the nadir far below, passing by many homes before depositing travelers at the market nearest my home.
Shops and stalls selling everything from cloth and stoneware to feather-filled cages, racks of alien cutlery, and fire-cooked food brought our communities together.

<!-- Like a valley floor, the bottom of this silo -->
When passing a gap between buildings or when the trail turned back down a prominent rocky outcrop, the vastness of the enclosure opened up before me. The bioluminescent colonies streaked down and away, colorful streams marking wall and floor extending down below and then up from behind, a long, curved roundness that defined the shape of our lives in the silo.

In the market, I stopped by a stall closest to the school, where Gû, one of Ágdá's clutch-mates, works. He sat behind the counter, waiting for customers. *A familiar feeling.* He buried his mottled green nose in a book of poetry, one of our school reading assignments, but I knew from Ágdá that this was not his first time reading it through.

"Hey Gû! Have you seen Ágdá since school?"

Gû glanced up from his book long enough for recognition to settle on his eyes. The inside of the market was well lit by lumi-globes, blobs of selectively bred bacteria, which glowed almost as bright as the electric lights in the Shipyard, but without the undercurrent of electricity that bothered my electroreceptors.

"Oh, hi, uh...Sasane?"

My look answered his question. *Not my name.* "It's Sase."

"Right, whatever. Ágdá said to tell you she'd be down by the produce gardens, something about potatees or potatoes or something like that."

With a kick, I was off. Time to head down.

****
<!-- TODO: expository lump -->
The silo we called home was shaped like a long bean resting longways, or a bird egg on its side. Buildings, houses, and other constructions occupied the transition toward 'too vertical to build' in a ring around the valley, but the bowl-like basin at the bottom was public land, shared by our community, and community gardens filled most of the arable surface area. While the bacterial and algal goop that the station was most known for grew elsewhere in the Burrow, inside biomechanical vats built by the founders, our community appreciated the variety that comes with other types of food, and so, having imported plants---seedlings, shoots, and bulbs---from off-station, we created these wide spaces in the oft-flooded bottom of our living world to grow for flavor more than sustenance.

Adena would keep us alive, but we took it upon ourselves to thrive.

Plus, having so many plants helped keep the local atmosphere healthy, easing the load on the Burrow's ancient atmospheric stabilization systems.

Ten minutes after leaving the market, I was skimming past rows of wheat, corn, and other staples.

Young families walked along a paved path around one of the floor's semi-permanent lakes, an old holding-pool that had accumulated enough nature over the centuries that it no longer appeared artificial.

I wound around terraces of rice, buried in pools of water, and skimmed through fields of lettuce and beets. <!-- TODO: add some alien plants -->

The markets and homes further up the walls relied on these gardens to bring people from around the galaxy together at a table, to share in tastes of an older time, of places abandoned but not forgotten.

Unlike many residents, I've never been off-station, having been born here in the Burrow.

<!-- TODO: what do young potato plants look like? -->
In time, I found the potatoes, still green leaves, a clump two inches off the ground.

I started looking. Along the edges of the garden. Alongside paths, near benches, behind rocks.

Looking for the telltale orange spots of Ágdá's trail.

I found them on a paved path that led along the wall-side edge, five orange dots in a semicircle, Ágdá's personal marker, directing me off the main trail at a t-shaped intersection.

The fresh paint led into the rock, to a steel door, like the dozens that littered the edges of our silo. While most remained locked, and all marked restricted, few people bothered testing the doors, because the hallways on the far side were often worse than dangerous --- they were boring.

I followed Ágdá's signs, small hints to the wise that this way led to something interesting.

## Twist

Inside, I walked through rough-hewn halls atop rusting metal grating. Dripping sounds were everywhere, a reminder of just how low I was relative to the silo. The ambient glow of the bioluminescence penetrated the walls like veins of metal. It, too, had made this moon its home.

I found Agda in the wide trench of a hexagonal tunnel, some ten feet down from the ledge I stood on, her bioelectric signature clear against the otherwise dull background electricity. Her canvas bag rested on the ground a few feet away from the wall she stood in front of, paint tubes in hand. She sprayed another swipe, adding a line of yellow that almost matched the vibrancy of her own. An older clutch-mate's shirt sat in a pile by her bag. Paint stained her hands and forearms, though further up, only colorful smudges disrupted the black dots and yellow base of her scales.

<!-- TODO: amp up the 'restricted area is sketchy' tone -->

## Reconciliation

"Glad you could make it," she said without turning around, no doubt detecting my own bioelectric signature.

Placing my board on the edge, I lowered myself down to the trench bottom, a run of smooth concrete with sloped edges on either side, the bottom three sides of the tunnel's hexagon.

"Good spot, Ágdá."

<!-- Emotion: familiarity and comfort: this is right -->

I grabbed my board with a small hop, then crossed the trench to stand by her side, board in hand.

She continued to face her work while I approached.

"What do you think? What does it need more of?"

I was never much of an artist, but had spent enough time with Ágdá to know when she wanted an actual answer. The piece was five feet tall and at least fifteen feet wide, a stylized depiction of the station, with the rocky Burrow to the right and the slender Shipyard to the left. *How long has she been working on this? I thought she just found this place?*

The colors looked...fine. Good even. She had better words for them, but to me, that was it.

"It looks good. I like the colors."

"Really? Nothing else to add? Come on, you've seen loads of my work. How does this compare to last month's?"

I shook my head, trying to wriggle free an answer. "Uh... I like the shapes on this one better, but it's harder to read your name on this one, and the yellow isn't as bright as your... uh..."

She turned her head just enough to glance at me through the side of her eyes, a small smile on her face. I tried to finish my thought, but looked away instead, my heart beating faster than it had been.

"Well anyway, how was your shift?"

"Oh, Doiay really loves that stupid motto. A few of the soldiers started a fight, but I was on my way out the door."

"You didn't stay to watch?" A hint of indignation.

"Uh, no. A few soldiers are not my concern, especially off the clock. Plus, I didn't want to keep you waiting."

I hopped on my board and started testing the slant beneath the mural as Ágdá picked a new set of colors from her bag.

Different activities.\
Same place.

*This is good.*

We talked for a while. Ágdá worked at a diner---The On-Planet Diner---and had her own version of Doiay, an adult human named Sej that annoyed her like Doiay did me. She asked why Kaysh let me skip detention. I assumed it was because I like his class (which was true---his class on micro-bio-programming was one of the few I studied for). We stayed there, skating and painting, until I asked about Hyok, our old classmate who works as an apprentice mechanic in the Shipyard's repair bays.

"Oh, don't be jealous," she said, before packing up her bag. "Come on, this one's done, and there's a deeper section I wanted to explore with you."

*I'm not jealous.*
