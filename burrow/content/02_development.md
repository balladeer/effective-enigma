## Introduction

I wound my way through the narrow, bare ahllways of rht eemployees-only back-halls before sliding out through a sublte door into one of hte Shipyard's public arteries and into the flow of people.
Again, the bold white-and-blue of the Shipyard's primary aesthetic glowed from every wall and ceiling, unwilling to be hidden by decades of dust.
At every corner and intersection, tiled into the floor and painted onto the walls, the solid-blue symbol of a human head, its only eye a white star, greeted me, a single bit of corporate paegentry left-over by the builders and miners that made the station.

My hoverboard bounced against my leg as I walked.
I eyed every nook and bench, but knew I wouldn't find a place to board here.
Some of the old merchants used to leave us alone, as long as we were quiet and customer traffic was light.
But now, after the Fee-nix injected a bunch of money into "revitalizing" the Shipyard, making it more tourist-friendly, there are Fee-nix-paid security guards, in their hideous black and green suites, patrolling every public space here.

Everything about the Shipyard moves in the direction of lighter, cleaner, more controlled.

Sterile.

That's why I prefer the Burrow.

Some folks think of it as 'going down' to the Burrow, others 'going over', 'going into', or 'going up'.
Direction is a funny thing on a space station.

Whatever the direction, I headed for the big hexogonal blastdoors that marked the gate between the Shipyard's shining, branching, void-facing modules and the excavated tunnels and chambers of the Burrow--a wandering moon, carved by the founders to extract materials long long ago, maybe before the War began.

The artery connected to a larger hallway, the already tall ceiling lifting up several floors above.
Shops lined the walls on every floor, but these shops were not meant for residents of the station like me.
They sold trips to far-away systems and fancy drinks in fancy bottles.
Flashing lights and fancy signs teased money out of the pockets of visitors.

I walked near the outer edge of the hall with other Kihǔ, a convention that kept the faster humans, with their muscle-filled legs as tall as me, near the center of traffic, where they could flow by without disturbing the rest of us.

Only residents were allowed into the Burrow proper, and that's where I was headed.
Ágdá should have finished her own shift in one of the Shipyard's restaurants a couple hours ago; she had found a new way into the restricted tunnels a few days ago and we were eager to go exploring.

I approached the Gateway, a giant hexagon of old metal, three stories tall, that led to the rail station and material processing bays.
Adena, the station's AI assisstant, kept the door open, it's black paneling contrasting with the Shipyard's harsh white brightness.

Strung across the hallway sat a trio of humanoid-sized checkpoints: chain-link fences with three controlled-entry doors installed and ribbon-cordoned lanes leading up to each, dividing people into two groups: visitors and residents.

When my turn arrived, I approached the terminal, the only Kihǔ in the line of eight residents transiting back to the rocky Burrow.
Ahead of me, the gray metal door slid shut.
I looked around for the stool that Adena typically provided for us; the hand-print reader was built for taller beings.

I stood up on my hind toes and swiped my right hand at the sensor.

_Unable to read handprint. Please try again._

"Adena, where's the stool?"

From a pair of speakers on either side of the locked door, the station's response arrived, too loud and too bassy, as usual.

"I'm sorry, resident Sase; a Republic soldier took it."

*Which color was that again?* I looked around for people wearing blue of any hue.

"Well, can you just let me through, Adena," I asked, reaching out to the door with my free hand.

The door flashed red.

"All persons passing through the gate must validate their status."

"Yeah, yeah, I know."

_Stupid station._

I glanced around.
Seeing no Fee-Nix security nearby, and hearing the agitation of those waiting behind me, I dropped my board to the ground.
It activated mid-fall, a subtle red glow lit the ground as it hovered up a few inches, never making contact with the tile floor.

I hopped on and, with a full body stretch upward, managed to plant my hand on the waiting sensor, holding it there long enough to hear the lock disengage.
The door itself slid to the side as I stepped off my board.

"Welcome, Resident Sase."

I rolled my eyes as I slid my hoverboard through the door toward the rail station.

Despite holding thousands of visitors at a time, the Shipyard was a rounding error compared to the volume of the Burrow it sprouted from.
Aboard one of Adena's rail shuttles, I sat with my back to the window, facing the floor.
If the bright electricity inside was bad, the silent void was worse.

The shuttle left the metal tube, traveling down an industrial rail that ran along the Shipyard's spine back to the rock of the Burrow.
While children sometimes looked out the windows, I preferred to keep my eyes on the floor.
There was nothing out there worth seeing.
*Worth knowing.*

I held my egg tooth between three fingers.
<!-- TODO: Anxious -->

A few minutes later, the shuttle passed into the moon, leaving the void behind, then departed the main spine, which they said traveled deep into the core of the Burrow back when extraction still ocurred, switching onto a smaller set of rails to make a trio of stops before returning to the Shipyard.
When the doors opened at my stop, I grabbed my pack and board, then hopped off the shuttle the station, exiting into a large, dim cavern, the storage cavity known as Silo 3.

Somewhere inside, Ágdá was waiting with a promise of hidden adventure.

My eyes adjusted and from the darkness arose familiar sights.
The rock walls that made up the boundaries of this place glimmered with wide washes of glwoing bacterial colonies.
Their dim light carried in the humid air, giving the entire cave a subtle glow.
A streak of blue reflected off the buildings to my left.
Stripes of red and orange and purple made the puddles in the road ahead pop with joy.

The humidity opened my scales, relieving the itch of my molt; the tingles and prickles that the Shipyard's dry, processed air caused eased.

Dim paths, marked by glowing paint filled with microbe nutrients, guided those who knew through the haphazard streets.
Board underfoot, I pushed off, hovering along into the mist.

Colors turned to streaks as I followed well-known signs.
Two purple squares marked the way back to the school, an old warehouse laboratory that they'd turned into a school, dozens of clutches before I was hatched.
I passed by with a wave, grateful that Teacher Kaysh---who was probably grateful to be home now that he had no one to keep in detention---had decided to let me off the hook tonight.

From there, I turned toward "blue square over green circle", a winding path leading down the curved edge of the cave toward the nadir far below, passing by many homes before depositing travlers at the market nearest my home.
Shops and stalls selling everything from cloth and stoneware to feather-filled cages, racks of alien cuttlery, and fire-cooked food served to bring our communities together.

At times, when passing a gap between buildings or when the trail turned back down a prominent rocky outcrop, the vastness of the enclosure opened up before me. The bioluminescent colonies streaked down and away, colorful streams marking wall and floor extending down below and then up from behind, a long, curved roundness that defined the shape of our lives in the silo.

In the market, I stopped
