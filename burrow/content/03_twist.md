## Scene Goal

Ágdá led me down the tunnel, past abandoned mine trucks and discarded equpiment piles.
I lazily kicked my board while she walked beside.
She pointed out old, forgotten path markings.
A white triangle here, which led to a door welded shut, a blatant arrow on the floor which led to a small room where multiple people had lived for sometime, possibly years.
Signs of times long passed.

Ágdá pointed out each new marker with small joy in her step.
"It really makes you feel connected, doens't it?
Seeing all of these old path markers.
Who made them?
What was their story?" <!-- TODO: Agda has more knowledge / history of who used these and how. -->

I viewed the markers with vague curiosity.
They were cool, but Ágdá saw something else in them.
Me, I found my gaze drawn to the veins of bacteria lighting our way.
Not two weeks ago, Teacher Kaysh taught that the species we use for light, the kind we find embedded in the rock of the Burrow itself, was native to this moon, discovered deep withing its core in the centuries after the founders started mining.

We left the main tunnel through an maintenance door, following a series of black circles with a small X above and to the right.
Any electronic security measures had been replaced with now-rusted locks decades ago. <!-- TODO: replace this -- analog locks are important later -->

Though narrow by founders' standards, the hall was still wide enough for two Kihû teens.
Board in hand, I walked by Ágdá through the dim.
The air was less humid here; we were getting further from the supply silo that housed my home.

Ágdá stopped as we passed an intersecting hallway to the right.
She reached her hand out across my chest.

"Hold up."

The hall, the lights, the branching intersection, it all looked unremarkable.
Shelves of abandoned equipment lined either side of side-hall, untouched in years.

Ágdá stepped between the nearest two selves, enough room for a single human, but not quite enough for the two of us.

"This hallway wasn't clear the last time I came this way."

I looked back the way we came then down the direction we were headed.
The main path was clear, if rough-hewn.

"What do you mean, there's  no one here."

"I'm telling you, these shelves weren't arranged like this when I passed by?"

"You've been here before? I thought we were exploring a new route you found."

"That door's still a ways away -- I've been down this hallway before.
I'm sure these shelves weren't like this." Ágdá wandered among the shelves, picking up old sensors and bits of ruined computers from wilted plastic containers.

<!-- Sase internal reaction -->
"Well, maybe Adena's maintenance bots finally found their way down here?"

Ágdá shook her head.

"The station doesn't patrol these old tunnels, and even if they did, the swarm would have cleaned up better than this.
They leave sectors clean and ready for people, not dank like this."

She wiped a bit of scum off one corner of the nearest shelving unit, showing it to me on her finger before wiping it on the floor.

<!-- TODO: remove mention of the Shipyard or the War from 02_development -->

I noticed the cool air, threatening a chill inside me.

<!-- TODO: denial -->

"What if its people working for Fee-Nix? They'd throw a fit if they caught us down here."

Ágdá rolled her eyes.

"They're not supposed to be down here either.
This area's restricted for everyone.
Plus, their investment is limited to the Shipyard.
Haven't you been paying attention in Station Civics?"

*No, obviously.
I hate that class.*

"Well why don't we go explore the area you were originally going to show me?" The itch of my molt returned; I rubbed my sleeves for relief.

"Nevermind that.
Look!"

She pointed to the wall, where the two hallways connected, towards a symbol we had not seen yet, painted a few inches off the ground; a square with two dots in the middle.
We crouched down to examine it closer, shoulders pressing together as we leaned in close.
<!-- TODO: introduce some sort of local light source -->
To me, it looked like the many others we had seen -- signs of an older time, used by people before us.

Ágdá saw something else.
"I haven't seen *this* symbol before.
Come on, let's see what's down here.
Maybe there are clues about who did this."
Ágdá stood and turned away, almost jogging between the shelves, leaving me crouched at the intersection.

<!-- TODO: add descriptions of pipes and duct work in the ceiling -->

*We're in the Burrow.
It's safe here.*

I followed.

## Crucible

Ten minutes and four inconspicuous trail markers later, I stood beside Ágdá looking up at an old door.
The electronics had been replaced with an analog lock sometime in the past.
<!-- show Ágdá 'picking' electronic locks earlier -->

"I don't suppose you know how to pick this one?"

Ágdá grunted, her face squishing inwards as she thought.
"No."
She shook her head.
"No, I don't."

I thought back to the dozens of shelves that lined the hallways we had passed.
"Maybe there's a crowbar, or something large enough to bash the lock off with back there?"

Ágdá threw an arm out to prevent me from retreating.
"We can't let anyone know we're here!"

"Do you think someone is still using these symbols? Why would anyone be down here?"

"Well, why are we down here?" Ágdá smirked.

"That's not---you know what I mean.
Why would anyone be doing stuff, locking doors and the like? You can't even get Adena's help down here!"

Ágdá's head swiveled to face me, the blue circles of her eyes locking onto mine.
"Maybe that's the point?"

*Why would someone avoid Adena?*

My shoulders shook off a chill.
I looked away, unwilling to stay in that thought with Ágdá.
The duct work running in the corner where the ceiling and wall met caught my eye---too small for an adult human, but merely uncomfortable for a human child or a fully grown Kihû.

My head lifted, I jogged away from the door to the nearest corner.
"What about the vent?"
There might be an obstruction in the way---a fan or condensor or grate---but we did not need to travel far, so we might get lucky.

Plus, we'd done similar things before.

Ágdá tapped my shoulder, a big grin across her face.
"You ready to get dusty?"

Ágdá caught up, following my gaze to the nearest shelf: four green metal poles with six thick plastic shelves running crosswise, the highest of which stood but two feet below a grate in the vents.

A few minutes later, I was stomach down on my hoverboard, egg-tooth tucked into my shirt, floating a few centimeters above the dust inside the vent, kicking forward with one leg at a time, the top of my backpack scraping along the top of the vent.
The wide bands of metal popped and groaned as I passed, the weight of my hovering body still pressing against the metal floor.
A greenish glow lit the path in front of me, courtesy a blob of lumikinetic algae Ágdá offered me for the front of my board.

I floated away from the vent where Ágdá waited to the corner of the hallway below, an intersection where the duct work split left, right, and forward.
I navigated the sharp left turn, grateful that only path-blocking fan was down the right path.
With luck, I would find a vent to exit the ducts straight ahead, past the locked door marked with the %%TODO-what-symbol?

"All-clear," I shout-whispered back to Ágdá; Something about being in a duct made talking feel unwise.
I dismounted, pushing the hoverboard back to Ágdá, who joined me at the ventersection, canvas bag in tow.
We stayed in separate vents, doing our bets to distribute our combined weight.
Neighter of us wanted to metal groans to turn to strains and a snap.

Back on my board, I clambered down the final stretch of vent, less than twenty meters until I passed the door.
I stopped at a T-junction.
To my left, the ducts continued a few meters before rising up.
Ahead, at the edge of the light, I could see the unmoving metal blades of a fan.
<!-- TODO: do Kihû have some sort of electric sense? -->
At the bottom of a intersection, a grate.

I agitated the green goop on my board until its glow strengthened, allowing me to make out shapes in the space below.
Large rectangles, bigger than me--desks or shelves, perhaps--filled the room.

I rolled off the hoverboard, maneuvered it behind me and, with as much force as I could muster, kicked it, sending a chorus of bangs backward as it bounced back toward Ágdá.

Crouching, over the junction, I kicked the grate free, then lowered myself through.

****

The room was small---no more than 4 meters to a side---and made of heavy stone walls, one carved and three constructed.
On either side of the natural wall, the adjoining walls held doors: the one that had blocked me on the left and its mirror on the right.

Unlike the hallways we had arrived from, the room was not abandoned.
A desk broke the path between the doors.
Shelves---not dissimilar to those in the hallways---were stocked with papers and rolls, boxes and containers.

My backpack and hoverboard rested beside the shelf we had climbed down, along with Ágdá's bag and the grate I'd kicked free.

"Ágdá, can you read this?"

I stood on the chair by the desk, peering down at a map laying atop it.
It depicted the station, *our* station.
There, the Shipyard, with its bays and rings.
The Spine.
The Burrow itself, with several of the storage communities circled and marked.
Several lines passed deeper into the moon, toward its core, further back in time.

Beneath the map, more diagrams.
Specific ship bays circled and annotated.
Papers filled with ink.
Routes through Silo 3.
*Paths through my home.*

<!-- TODO: Sase emotional reaciton -->

Ágdá joined me on the chair, one knee on the desk itself.
We examined the papers before us.

"No, I can't read it; this isn't any laugnage I know.
Though---"
She paused.

"The War?" A knot formed in my stomach.

Ágdá looked up from the diagrams and nodded.

"Yeah---"

A hopped off the chair, away from the desk.
"What is all this doing here?"
My eyes scanned the shelves, chests, and containers.
All of this took work.
"And why use paper? That just makes it harder for---"

"---for Adena to know about this."
Ágdá joined me back on the floor.
"They don't want Adena to know, to hear whispers of whatever they are doing in the data streams."

## Setback (or Victory)
I rubbed my molting scales, arms crossed to let me massage each arm at once.
"Should we tell someone?"

Ágdá opened her mouth to say something, but then we both felt it.
Along the side of my face

Electricity.

Life.

*Something's coming.*

<!-- TODO: establish how Sase got down from the vent -->

I looked at the ground, as if boring my eyes would sharpen my ears.
No voices, no thumps or approaching steps.
*Not yet.*

Ágdá grabbed her bag and headed for the shelves we'd descended from.
I adjusted the chair and tried to square up the maps, then grabbed my backpack and board from the wall where I'd left them and joined her.

A faint mumble of voices emerged from behind the left door.
My electroreceptors told me a large biomass was headed our way, enough for at least six Kihû.
Or three humans.

I passed Ágda---now in the vent---my hoverboard.

"Which way do we go?" I whispered, trying to keep my volume down as I crawled into the vent, ending up across from the hole I'd just entered through, facing Ágdá.

Her eyes were wide and I'm sure our hearts were echoing in the vent.

"They'll hear us if we go back," I said.

"They'll us if we move at all. Did you grab the grate?"

We each stared at the other.

The door that had blocked us shook as someone worked the lock on the far side. Muffled voices continued their conversation.

I peeked down.
The grate was on the floor, leaning against the wall.
*Maybe they won't notice.*

The door swung inward and the blue-white glow of an electric light filled the room below us.

We held our breaths.

<!--
Who enters?
1. Kaysh: teacher and unwilling spy
2. Jawnpil : F Human - sympathetic, existing resident
3. Nokelfod: M Human - new resident

What are they doing?
Getting an update from Kaysh.
 -->
"Finally," said a woman's voice. Too deep to be Kihû.

Footsteps entered the room.
Grunts preceded a *clank* as something heavy was placed on the floor.

"We should get a cart next time," said the woman.

"It wasn't that heave," said a man.

Closer now, and without the door and distance to interfere, the bioelectric signals of the group resolved.

Two humans and a Kihû

*And a Kihû*

I looked over at Ágdá who, having realized the same thing, was looking back at me, eyes wide in the dim.

*We can't hide from a Kihû.*

The door clicked shut, the three bodies met at the desk with the maps. One of the humans took the chair, while the other humanand the Kihû---after grabbing a stool from a shelf---stood next to each other, across the desk from the chair.

"Ok, now we can talk openly," said the woman. "Nokelfod, how are you settling in? Any issues with your place?"

"No m'am. The place is fine. I'm not looking forward to years living in the damp, but I've had far worse assignments than Silo 3."

The life in the humans buzzed and bubbled; they were relaxed.
The Kihû's bioelectricity was flat and sturdy, like pool of water, controlled for now, waiting for someone to throw a rock in and make some waves.

"You'll get used to the damp and the dim. It grows on you after a couple of months."

"Yes m'am."

"And you, how are the residence permits coming along?"

A ripple in the Kihu's pool. "I have managed to wipe two more. Adena's got protocols buried in protocols. Washing the permits is slow, but not blocked."

"Pick up the pace, we'll need more---"

"Wait," said the man, "wasn't there a grate on that vent?"

My heart jumped. I stifled a yelp.

The bioelectricity in the room below sizzled and snapped as the occupants scrambled about.

"Wait a sec--Nokelfod, turn off your light," said the woman.

With a click, the electric lamp went out.

"There's a green glow coming from the vent!"

*What do I do? What do I do?*

Ágdá sat motionless, her body in the vent that led back to the shelf we had entered through.
I was wedged across from her, an metal fan several meters behind me blocking any escape.
To my right, the vent extended several meters before bending upward into a vertical shaft.

"What do you we do?" Ágdá mouthed the words from her position across the open gap between us.
Any movement would make noise as the vent sustained our unplanned weight.
I gestured to the vertical shaft with my eyes. "Over there?"

<!-- TODO: More emotional tells from Ágdá and Sase -->

<!-- TODO: what's a good derogatoroy term humans could use for Kihû? -->
"Little one, you can fit through that hole, right? Go check it out."
The woman's voice was just above a whisper.

I glared at the glowing green blob on the hoverboard beside Ágdá, wishing the tiny creatures inside had gone dark soon, that I had not agitated them back into brightness, that I was not here, stuck in a vent.

Ágdá's eyes shined. When she squished them shut, tears slid out from each, flowing down her cheeks.
Beneath us, the Kishû clambered up the same shelving unit we had used minutes ago.
The blue-white glow of a flashlight flicked on, far brighter than the dimming light of my glow-blob.
The light washed out my eyes; I shrunk my head back into my neck, shutting my eyes tight.

*Get away. Get away. Get away.*

The flashlight passed over my eyelids, a warm, all-encompassing beam that scattered thoughts.
I tried to withdraw further into my shoulders.

The light departed.

I peeked open one eye. My retina adjusted.

Not a half-meter from my face, a head covered in red-violet scales poked through the grate hole.

*Teacher Kaysh?*

He was holding the flashlight in one arm, pointing it toward the vertical shaft, while the other extended down the vent beside Ágdá, the creamy-white skin of his underside coated in dust.
I opened my mouth to speak, but my teacher's eyes grew wide, his subtle head shake shutting me up.
He turned his head toward Ágdá---who was shaking, her lips drawn in as tight as she could muster---and with his flashlight hand, Kaysh plucked the glow-blob from the hoverboard and lowered it back through the grate.

He tilted his head down enough to talk to the two humans below.

"There was someone up here; they left this behind. Give me a moment to look for anything else."

Kaysh brought his eyes up and met mine.
"Don't move," he mouthed, before turning to Ágdá.
Then he lowered himself down and out of the vent.
"Hand me that grate; I'll reinstall it while I'm up here."

The thin line of the grate appeared in the hole, and with some effort, the grate was reattached.

I looked at Ágdá.

She looked at me.

Beneath us, commotion. Hurried, urgent whispers.

My muscles grew sore; I stayed where I was, lying on my stomach, unwilling to stretch so much as a toe.
My molting scales burned, but the burn faded with time.
So, too, did the light.

****

Silence returned.

In the quiet dark, Ágdá's bio-presence remained, quiet, nervous, and withdrawn.

"Are they gone?" she whispered, her words fearing to cross the grate-shaped gap between us.

I strained my ears and electro-receptors.
Nothing.
"I think so."

We waited.
Breaths passed.

Deep creaks and groans pinged the vents from deep or far.
Chills gripped my aching muscles.

"Let's get out of here," I said. "There's a button on the side of my board, near the back. Can you feel it?"

A soft red glow flicked on, enough for sillhouettes, but no more.
The Ágdá-shape shifted onto the now-hovering board.

The vent gave out a loud groan.

Both of us froze.
We waited.

Nothing came.

"Let's go."

Ágdá withdrew a glow-blob from her canvas bag to light our way.
We worked our way back through the vents, every bang and buckle of the metal sending a jolt of fear through my heart.
We emerged back into the hallway, the sudden loss of the vent's tight quarters leaving me exposed and vulnerable.

We looked at each other, neither sure what to say. Ágdá headed toward the lock door; I folloewd close behind.

The door was open, it's lock removed.

Across the way, the far door stood ajar. Inside, bare shelves and an empty metal desk were all that was left.

"How long do you think we were up there?" I asked, embarassed I had nothing more important to ask.

"I dunno, a couple of hours, I think" Ágdá walked around the room, her right arm held high, massaging the glow-bulb to keep it well lit.

"Were those soldiers, do you think?"

*Soldiers, outside the Shipyard*

Ágdá finished her loop of the room. "Spies, probably. That was Teacher Kaysh, wasn't it? What was he doing with them?"

"And why did he let us go?" I thought back to the stern look in his eyes as Keysh mouthed the words "Don't move" to me.

*Soldiers in Silo 3*

Ágdá patted my shoulder. "We should tell someone about this, someone in the silo should know."

"Ágdá, who are we going to tell? Who would listen? Teacher Kaysh is who I would have gone to, but he's in the middle of it." I shook my head and observed my dusty shoes.

"Well we need to tell someone!"

"Yeah, I suppose so," I said, the growing knot in my stomach threatening nausea. "Ágdá, I'd like to go home. Can you get us out of here?"
