## Scene Goal

Ágdá led me down the tunnel, past abandoned mine trucks and discarded equpiment piles.
I lazily kicked my board while she walked beside.
She pointed out old, forgotten path markings.
A white triangle here, which led to a door welded shut, a blatant arrow on the floor which led to a small room where multiple people had lived for sometime, possibly years.
Signs of times long passed.

Ágdá pointed out each new marker with small joy in her step.
"It really makes you feel connected, doens't it?
Seeing all of these old path markers.
Who made them?
What was their story?" <!-- TODO: Agda has more knowledge / history of who used these and how. -->

I viewed the markers with vague curiosity.
They were cool, but Ágdá saw something else in them.
Me, I found my gaze drawn to the veins of bacteria lighting our way.
Not two weeks ago, Teacher Kaysh taught that the species we use for light, the kind we find embedded in the rock of the Burrow itself, was native to this moon, discovered deep withing its core in the centuries after the founders started mining.

We left the main tunnel through an maintenance door, following a series of black circles with a small X above and to the right.
Any electronic security measures had been replaced with now-rusted locks decades ago. <!-- TODO: replace this -- analog locks are important later -->

Though narrow by founders' standards, the hall was still wide enough for two Kihǔ teens. Board in hand, I walked by Ágdá through the dim. The air was less humid here; we were getting further from the supply silo that housed my home.

Ágdá stopped as we passed an intersecting hallway to the right. She reached her hand out across my chest.

"Hold up."

The hall, the lights, the branching intersection, it all looked unremarkable. Shelves of abandoned equipment lined either side of side-hall, untouched in years.

Ágdá stepped between the nearest two selves, enough room for a single human, but not quite enough for the two of us.

"This hallway wasn't clear the last time I came this way."

I looked back the way we came then down the direction we were headed. The main path was clear, if rough-hewn.

"What do you mean, there's  no one here."

"I'm telling you, these shelves weren't arranged like this when I passed by?"

"You've been here before? I thought we were exploring a new route you found."

"That door's still a ways away -- I've been down this hallway before. I'm sure these shelves weren't like this." Ágdá wandered among the shelves, picking up old sensors and bits of ruined computers from wilted plastic containers.

<!-- Sase internal reaction -->
"Well, maybe Adena's maintenance bots finally found their way down here?"

Ágdá shook her head.

"The station doesn't patrol these old tunnels, and even if they did, the swarm would have cleaned up better than this. They leave sectors clean and ready for people, not dank like this."

She wiped a bit of scum off one corner of the nearest shelving unit, showing it to me on her finger before wiping it on the floor.

<!-- TODO: remove mention of the Shipyard or the War from 02_development -->

I noticed the cool air, threatening a chill inside me.

<!-- TODO: denial -->

"What if its people working for Fee-Nix? They'd throw a fit if they caught us down here."

Ágdá rolled her eyes.

"They're not supposed to be down here either. This area's restricted for everyone. Plus, their investment is limited to the Shipyard. Haven't you been paying attention in Station Civics?"

*No, obviously. I hate that class.*

"Well why don't we go explore the area you were originally going to show me?" The itch of my molt returned; I rubbed my sleeves for relief.

"Nevermind that. Look!"

She pointed to the wall, where the two hallways connected, towards a symbol we had not seen yet, painted a few inches off the ground; a square with two dots in the middle.
We crouched down to examine it closer, shoulders pressing together as we leaned in close. <!-- TODO: introduce some sort of local light source -->
To me, it looked like the many others we had seen -- signs of an older time, used by people before us.

Ágdá saw something else.
"I haven't seen *this* symbol before. Come on, let's see what's down here. Maybe there are clues about who did this." Ágdá stood and turned away, almost jogging between the shelves, leaving me crouched at the intersection.

*We're in the Burrow. It's safe here.*

I followed.

## Crucible

<!-- THOUGHT: What if Sase's molting scales cause a problem? Maybe they get left behind and the spies notice? -->

## Setback (or Victory)
