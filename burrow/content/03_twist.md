## Scene Goal

Ágdá led me down the tunnel, past abandoned mine trucks and discarded equipment piles.
I lazily kicked my board while she walked beside.
She pointed out old, forgotten path markings.
A white triangle here, which led to a door welded shut, a blatant arrow on the floor which led to a small room where multiple people had lived for sometime, possibly years.
Signs of times long passed.

Ágdá pointed out each new marker with small joy in her step.
"It really makes you feel connected, doesn't it? Seeing these old path markers. Who made them? What was their story?"
<!-- TODO: Agda has more knowledge / history of who used these and how. -->

I viewed the markers with vague curiosity.
They were cool, but Ágdá saw something else in them.
Me, I found my gaze drawn to the veins of bacteria lighting our way.
Not two weeks ago, Teacher Kaysh taught that the species we use for light, the kind we find embedded in the rock of the Burrow itself, was native to this moon, discovered deep within its core in the centuries after the founders started mining.

We left the main tunnel through a maintenance door, following a series of black circles with a small X above and to the right. When we reached a locked door, Ágdá pulled out her handheld computer and made short work of the ancient security lock, opening the door with a scratchy *beep* and a *thunk* as the bolt slid out of place.

Though narrow by founders' standards, the hall was still wide enough for two Kihû teens.
Board in hand, I walked by Ágdá through the dim.
The air was less humid here; we were getting further from the supply silo that housed my home.

Ágdá stopped as we passed an intersecting hallway to the right.
She reached her hand out across my chest.

"Wait."

The hall, the lights, the branching intersection, everything looked unremarkable.
Shelves of abandoned equipment lined either side of side-hall, untouched in years.

Ágdá stepped between the nearest two shelves, enough room for a single human, but not quite enough for the two of us.

"This hallway wasn't clear the last time I came this way."

I looked back the way we came, then down the direction we had headed.
The main path was clear, if rough-hewn.

"What do you mean? There's no one here."

"I'm telling you, these shelves weren't arranged like this when I passed by last."

"You've been here before? I thought we were exploring a new route you found."

"That door's still a ways away---I've been down this hallway before. I'm sure these shelves weren't like this."

"Like what?" I asked. "Abandoned?"

Ágdá wandered among the shelves, picking up old sensors and bits of ruined computers from wilted plastic containers. "No, I mean, walkable. Passable. This hallway was a mess when I last passed by."

<!-- Sase internal reaction -->
"Well, maybe Adena's maintenance bots found their way here?"

Ágdá shook her head.

"The station doesn't patrol these tunnels. If they did, the swarm would have cleaned up better than this. They leave sectors clean and ready for people, not *dank*."

She wiped a fleck of scum off the nearest shelving unit, showing it to me on her finger before wiping it on the floor.

<!-- TODO: remove mention of the Shipyard or the War from 02_development -->

The cool air threatened a chill inside me.

<!-- TODO: denial -->

"What if it's people working for Fee-Nix? They'd get us in major trouble if they caught us in these tunnels."

Ágdá scoffed.

"They're not supposed to be here either. This whole area's restricted for everyone. Plus, they limited their investment to the Shipyard. Haven't you been paying attention in Station Civics?"

*No. I hate that class.*

"Well, why don't we go explore the door we've been talking about?" The itch of my molt returned; I rubbed my sleeves for relief.

"Nevermind that. Look!"

She pointed to the wall, where the two hallways connected, towards a symbol we had not seen yet, painted a few inches off the ground; a square with two dots in the middle.
We crouched down to examine it closer, shoulders pressing together as we leaned in close.
<!-- TODO: introduce a local light source -->
To me, it looked like the many others we had seen---signs of an older time, used by people before us.

Ágdá saw something else.
"I haven't seen *this* symbol, though. Let's see what's down this hallway. There could be clues about who did this."
Ágdá stood and turned away, jogging between the shelves, leaving me crouched at the intersection.

<!-- TODO: add descriptions of pipes and ductwork in the ceiling -->

*We're in the Burrow.
It's safe here.*

I followed.

## Crucible

Ten minutes and four inconspicuous trail markers later, I stood beside Ágdá looking up at an old door.
In the recent past, someone had replaced the electronics with an analog lock, too free of buildup to have been here for decades.

"I don't suppose you know how to pick this one?"

Ágdá grunted, her face squishing inwards as she thought.
"No."
She shook her head.
"No, I don't."

I thought of the dozens of shelves lining the hallways we had passed.
"Maybe there's a crowbar, or something large enough to bash the lock off with back there?"

Ágdá threw an arm out to prevent me from retreating.
"We can't let anyone know we're here!"

"Do you think someone is still using these symbols? Why would anyone be down here?"

"Well, why are we down here?" Ágdá smirked.

"That's not---you know what I mean. Why would anyone be doing stuff, locking doors and moving shelves? You can't even get Adena's help down here!"

Ágdá's head swiveled to face me, the blue circles of her eyes locking onto mine.
"What if that's the point?"

*Why would someone avoid Adena?*

My shoulders shook off a chill.
I looked away, unwilling to stay in that thought with Ágdá.
The duct work running in the corner where the ceiling and wall met caught my eye---too small for an adult human, but merely uncomfortable for a human child or a fully grown Kihû.

My head lifted. I jogged away from the door to the nearest corner.
"What about the vent?"
There might be an obstruction in the way---a fan or condenser or grate---but we did not need to travel far, so we might get lucky.

Plus, we'd done similar things before.

Ágdá tapped my shoulder, a big grin on her face.
"You ready to get dusty?"

Ágdá caught up, following my gaze to the nearest shelf: four green metal poles with six thick plastic shelves running crosswise, the highest of which stood but two feet below a grate in the vents.

A few minutes later, I was stomach down on my hoverboard, egg-tooth tucked into my shirt, floating a few centimeters above the dust inside the vent, kicking forward with one leg at a time, the top of my backpack scraping along the top of the vent.
The wide bands of metal popped and groaned as I passed, the weight of my hovering body still pressing against the metal floor.
A greenish glow lit the path in front of me, courtesy of a blob of lumikinetic algae Ágdá offered me for the front of my board.

I floated away from the vent where Ágdá waited to the corner of the hallway below, an intersection where the duct work split left, right, and forward.
I navigated the sharp left turn, grateful that only path-blocking fan was further down the right path.
With luck, I would find a vent to exit the ducts straight ahead, past the locked door.

"All-clear," I shout-whispered back to Ágdá; being in a duct made talking at normal volume unwise.
I dismounted, pushing the hoverboard back to Ágdá, who joined me at the ventersection, canvas bag in tow.
We stayed in separate corners, doing our best to distribute our combined weight; neither of us wanted the metal groans to turn to strains and snaps.

Back on my board, I clambered across the last stretch of vent, less than twenty meters, until I passed over the door, stopping at a T-junction.
To my left, the ducts continued a few meters before rising.
Ahead, at the edge of the green light, I saw the unmoving metal blades of a fan.
At the bottom of the intersection, a grate.

I agitated the green goop on my board until its glow strengthened, allowing me to peer through the grate and make out shapes in the space below.
Large rectangles, bigger than me---desks or shelves, perhaps---filled the room.

I rolled off the hoverboard, maneuvered it behind me and, launched it back with my left leg, sending a chorus of bangs backward as it ricocheted toward Ágdá.

Crouching over the junction, I kicked the grate free, then lowered myself through.

****

The room was small---only 4 meters to a side---and made of heavy stone walls, one carved and three constructed.
On either side of the natural wall, the adjoining walls held doors: the one that had blocked me on the left and its mirror on the right.

<!-- START: Inkscapes submssion -->
Unlike the hallways we had arrived from, the room was not abandoned.
Shelves---like those in the hallways---filled the walls with boxes, crates, and appliances.
A paper-filled desk disrupted the path between the room's two doors.

My backpack and hoverboard rested beside the shelf we had descended, along with Ágdá's bag and the grate I'd kicked free.

I climbed onto a chair by the desk, peering at a map laying atop it.
It showed the station. *Our* station.
There, the Shipyard, with its bays and rings.
The Spine.
The Burrow itself, with circles around several community silos.
Dangerous lines passed deeper into the moon, toward its core, further back in time.

I nibbled at the flaking scales on my hand while looking at my home through an outsider's eyes.

"Ágdá, can you read this?"

She joined me on the chair, one knee resting on the desk itself.

Beneath the map, more diagrams.
Ship bays circled and annotated.
Papers filled with ink.
Routes through Silo 3.
*Routes through my home.*

"No, I can't read it," she said, "Though I recognize the characters." Ágdá paused.

"The War?" My stomach tightened.

Her shoulders sank. She nodded.

I hopped off the chair, away from the desk.
"What is all this doing here?"
My eyes scanned the shelves.
This took effort: to haul in, arrange, and hide.
"And why use paper? That just makes it harder for---"

"---for Adena to find."
Ágdá joined me back on the floor.
"They don't want the station to know, to find whispers of their work in the data streams."

## Setback
I rubbed my molting scales, arms crossed to let me massage each arm at once.
"Should we tell someone?"

Ágdá opened her mouth to respond, but then we both felt it.
Up my cheeks, along the sides of my face.

Electricity.

Life.

*Someone's coming.*

I shut my eyes to sharpen my ears.
No voices. No approaching steps.
*Not yet.*

Ágdá grabbed her bag and rushed for the shelves to the vent.
I adjusted the chair and tidied the maps, then joined her, grabbing my backpack and board.

A faint mumble emerged from behind the left door.
My electroreceptors revealed the large biomass headed our way, enough for at least six Kihû.
Or three humans.

I passed Ágdá---now in the vent---my hoverboard. She stashed it as her side, then reached for my bag.

"Which way do we go?" I whispered as I crawled into the vent.

She had jammed her arms underneath her, hugging herself.
My heartbeat echoed in the vent.

"They'll hear us if we go back," she hissed.

"They'll hear us if we move at all," I replied.

"Did you grab the grate?"

We each stared at the other in the green dim.

The door that had blocked us shook as someone worked the lock on the far side.
Muffled voices continued their conversation.

I peeked down.
The grate was on the floor, leaning against the wall.
*Maybe they won't notice.*

The door swung inward, causing us each to flinch. The blue-white glow of an electric light flooded the room below us.

We held our breaths.

"Finally," said a woman's voice. Too deep to be Kihû.

Footsteps entered the room.
Grunts preceded a *clank* as someone put something heavy on the floor.

"Get a cart next time," said the woman.

"Not that heavy," said a man.

Closer now, and without the door and distance to interfere, the group's bioelectric signals resolved.

Two humans and a Kihû.

*And a Kihû*

I looked over at Ágdá, whose wide eyes told me she had realized the same thing.

*We can't hide from a Kihû.*

The door clicked shut and the three bodies met at the desk with the maps. One human took the chair, while the other human and the Kihû---after grabbing a stool from a shelf---stood next to each other opposite the seated individual.

"Ok, now we can talk without the station hearing," said the woman. "Nokelfod, how are you settling in? Any issues with your residence?"

"No, thank you. The place is fine. I'm not looking forward to living in the damp, but I've had far worse assignments than Silo 3."

The life in the humans buzzed and bubbled. They were relaxed.
The Kihû's bioelectricity settled, flat and sturdy, like a pool of water waiting for someone to throw a rock in.

"You'll get used to the damp and the dim. It grows on you after a couple of months. And you, how are the residence permits coming along?"

A ripple in the Kihû's pool. "I wiped two more. Adena has protocols buried in protocols. Washing the permits is slow, but not dangerous."

"Pick up the pace, we'll need more before---"

"Wait," said the man, "wasn't there a grate on that vent?"

My heart jumped. I stifled a yelp.

The bioelectricity in the room below sizzled and snapped as the occupants scrambled about.

"Light off," said the woman.

*Click.* The electric lamp went out.

"There's a green glow coming from the vent!" said the human Nokelfod.

*What do I do? What do I do?*

Ágdá sat motionless in the vent that led back to the shelf we had entered through.
I had ended up across from her, a metal fan behind me blocking escape in that direction.
To my right, the vent extended several meters before bending upward into a vertical shaft.

My scales ached as I raced through options. Dive for the vertical shaft and hope it led to safety. Wait here and hope we stay hidden. Jump out and surprise them, then escape in the confusion. Every choice ended poorly.

"What do we do?" Ágdá mouthed the words from across the open gap between us.
Any movement would make noise as the vent strained against our unplanned weight.
I gestured to the vertical shaft with my eyes. "Over there?"

"Lizard, you can fit through that hole, right? Investigate."
The woman's voice was a focused whisper.

I glared at the glowing green blob on the hoverboard beside Ágdá, wishing the tiny creatures inside had gone dark sooner, that I had not agitated them back into brightness, that I was not here, stuck in a vent.
My muscles tensed. I wanted to move, to go somewhere, anywhere, but couldn't. My knees and elbows turned chill and heavy, as if locked in ice blocks.

Ágdá's eyes shined. When she squished them shut, tears slid out from each.

Beneath us, the Kihû clambered up the same shelving unit we had used moments ago.
A flashlight flicked on, far brighter than the dimming light of my glow-blob.
The blue-white light washed out my vision. I shrunk my head back into my neck, shutting my eyes tight.

*---get away get away get away---*

The flashlight passed over my eyelids, a warm beam that scattered my thoughts. The intruder's bioelectric presence filled the space in front of me, trapping me in the vent.
As I tried to withdraw further into my shoulders, the light departed.

I peeked open an eye.
My retina adjusted.

Not a half-meter from my face, a head covered in red-violet scales poked through the grate hole.

*Teacher Kaysh?*

He held the flashlight in one arm, pointing it toward the vertical shaft, while the other arm extended into the vent beside Ágdá, the creamy-white skin of its underside coated in dust.
I opened my mouth to speak, but my teacher's eyes grew wide. His subtle head shake kept me quiet.
My teacher turned his head toward Ágdá---her lips drawn in as tight as she could muster---and with his free hand, plucked the glow-blob from the hoverboard and lowered it back through the grate.

He tilted his head down enough to talk to the two humans below.

"There was someone up here; they left this behind. I'm going to check for anything else."

Kaysh brought his eyes up and met mine.
"Don't move," he mouthed, before turning to Ágdá.
Then he lowered himself out of the vent.
"Hand me the grate. I'll reinstall it while I'm up here," he said as if the vents were empty.

The thin lines of the grate appeared in the hole as Kaysh reattached it to the vent, blocking most of the light and leaving us in near-total darkness.

I looked toward Ágdá's silhouette, trying to mimic her stillness.

Beneath us, commotion.
Hurried, urgent whispers.
The ruckus of a secretive labor.

My muscles tightened.
I stayed still, lying on my stomach, unwilling to stretch so much as a toe.
My molting scales burned, but the itch faded with time.
So, too, did the remaining light from below.
<!-- STOP: Inkscapes submssion -->

****

Silence returned.

In the quiet dark, only Ágdá's bio-presence remained, quiet, nervous, and withdrawn.

"Are they gone?" she whispered, her words fearing to cross the grate-shaped gap between us.

I strained my ears and electro-receptors.
Nothing.
"I think so."

We waited longer.

Deep creaks and groans pinged the vents from deep or far.
Chills gripped my aching muscles.

"Let's get out of here," I said. "There's a button on the side of my board, near the back. Can you feel it?"

The rustling of clothing. A soft red glow flicked on, enough for silhouettes, but no more.
The Ágdá-shape shifted onto the now-hovering board.

The vent gave out a loud groan.

Both of us froze.
We waited.

Nothing came.

"Let's go."

Ágdá withdrew another glow-blob from her canvas bag to light our way.
We worked our way back through the vents, every bang and buckle of the metal sending a jolt of fear through my heart.
We emerged back into the hallway, the sudden loss of the vent's tight quarters leaving me exposed.

We looked at each other, neither sure of what to say. Ágdá headed toward the locked door; I followed close behind.

The door was open, its lock removed.

Across the way, the far door stood ajar. Inside, bare shelves and an empty metal desk were all that remained of the office we had found. Whomever Teacher Kaysh had been with had cleared the room well.

"How long do you think we were up there?" I asked, embarrassed that I had nothing more important to ask.

"I dunno. A couple of hours, I think." Ágdá walked around the room, her right arm held high, massaging the glow-bulb to keep it well lit.

"Were those soldiers, do you think?" I asked.

*Soldiers, outside the Shipyard.*

Ágdá finished her tour of the room. "Spies, I think. That was Teacher Kaysh, wasn't it? What was he doing with them?"

"And why did he let us go?" I thought back to the stern look in his eyes as Kaysh mouthed the words "don't move" to me.

*Spies in Silo 3.*

Ágdá patted my shoulder. "We should tell someone about this. Someone in the silo should know."

"Ágdá, who are we going to tell? Who would listen? Teacher Kaysh is who I would have gone to, but he's in the middle of it." I shook my head and observed my dusty shoes.

"Well, we need to tell someone!"

"Yeah, I suppose so," I said, the growing knot in my stomach threatening nausea. "Ágdá, I'd like to go home. Can you get us out of here?"
