## Scene Goal

Ágdá led me down the tunnel, past abandoned mine trucks and discarded equpiment piles.
I lazily kicked my board while she walked beside.
She pointed out old, forgotten path markings.
A white triangle here, which led to a door welded shut, a blatant arrow on the floor which led to a small room where multiple people had lived for sometime, possibly years.
Signs of times long passed.

Ágdá pointed out each new marker with small joy in her step.
"It really makes you feel connected, doens't it?
Seeing all of these old path markers.
Who made them?
What was their story?"

I viewed the markers with vague curiosity.
They were cool, but Ágdá saw something else in them.
Me, I found my gaze drawn to the veins of bacteria lighting our way.
Not two weeks ago, Teacher Kaysh taught that the species we use for light, the kind we find embedded in the rock of the Burrow itself, was native to this moon, discovered deep withing its core in the centuries after the founders started mining.


## Crucible

<!-- THOUGHT: What if Sase's molting scales cause a problem? Maybe they get left behind and the spies notice? -->

## Setback (or Victory)
