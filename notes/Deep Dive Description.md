# Exercise 1
Timestamp: 22-06-04 13:12

Picture game: describe two pictures of people.

I chose a picture of a young black girl and her father and then an older asian man.

"Closed door writing" vs "open door editing"
> You can't offend anyone if they don't see it. -- K. Tempest
- get your words out behind closed doors -- let go of your self-consciousness

Goal of this: "Get comfortable behind the closed door, so that you'll be ready to open the door."

> All of us make assumptions about people. That's ok. But, think about where they come from.

> We all have junk in our head...Part of doing this work is to recognize that it is not a moral condemnation to recognize that.

First step: just describe the person / your characters, especially in your first draft.

Finding common ground between you and another to help bridge to the misc.

# Lecture 1
The two major poitns of problematic
- Characterization
- Language

Often white, western writers are unwilling to mark race (and other identifiers). You don't need to ditch all your writing tools, but get comfortable with marking ways characters are different from the dominant paradigm.

This flies in the face of the super-liberal idea that to notice or mark race is, itself, racist. There's nothing wrong with your characters noticing the race of others -- it's what they do when they notice that matters.

Advice 1: state the basics. Don't leave the dominant groups unmarked.

Be as specific as makes sense for your character.
- "Chocktow" is better than "Native American"
- If your characters don't know the specifics, it's okay to _acknowledge that_.
- Not all identities and backgrounds can be visually found.

> In many cases, basic descriptors are enough.
Especially for first-drafts. Refine or add more specificity in future drafts.

Which words for to use?
> Don't reach for the easy.

Example: don't use food metaphors for describing PoC.
- It reduces people to commodities.
- The foods typically used are very often tied to commodity trading and colonialism.

How to get away: build a vocabulary
- Use the ['Writing with Color'](https://writingwithcolor.tumblr.com/post/96830966357/words-for-skin-tone-how-to-describe-skin-color) guide
- Look up the resources for 'language and description'

Are you using flowery language for all your characters? Or just folks marked as 'other'?

> Excavate your brins for the unconscious choices you are making

## Received language
Skin-tone is not the only aspect to consider!
- Again, don't reach for the easy!

Other descriptions with connotations to be aware of:
- Asian people's eyes as 'almond' shaped
	+ It's over-used
	+ It carries a lot of baggage beyond the literal shape
	+ "Asian" covers a lot of peoples
		* eye shape differs wildly
		* None of their eyes are almond shaped -- they tend to match white people's eyes better

Watch out for other cases of 'received' language (like 'almond-shaped eyes') and be super wary of them.

Another tool for description: Comparison
- Does your POV think their view is the default?
- How do _they_ believe they look? Others?
- Do other characters remind them of someone in their own background?
	+ Use answers to these questions to help represent difference.

> Descriptions flow from character
- What does your character notice, and why?
- How do these tendencies reflect their own race, age, etc

Marginalized people often notice things about people form the dominant paradigm that those same folks never have to think about
- surviving the dominant group means noticing details about them

## Deceptive Appearances
- When describing characters from another character's POV
	+ People who are pegged as part of one identity when they're from another
		* Often not intentional
		* Examples: 'white passing' individuals who nevertheless belong to a marginalized group
> There are people from every race and ethnicity who make look like they belong to another race or ethnicity

> Many people assume any lighter-skinned Black character is mixed race.

Noting these contrasts, how these characters are perceived and react, can add nuance to such description.

This doesn't have to be a major aspect of a character's description.

K. Tempest moved to a Dominican neighborhood. Despite being black, she was treated as Dominican
- a mostly invisible impact: she was treated like she belonged

Repetition, repetition, and more repetion is the key to helping readers visualize your characters.

The way you choose to identify, regardless of mix in background, impacts your life. It can reflect the reality of your experience.
- e.g. Some mixed race folks strongly identify Black, while others may emphasize being mixed-race.

For characters that emphasize they are, for example, multi-racial, what path has led them to focusing on that identity
- how are they perceived?
- how do they wish to be perceived?

> Skin color is over-utilized as a marker
- The way people talk is different
- Ultimately, race is made up.
	+ White readers regularly miss that African-descended people often have dry skin
		* vaseline
		* leave-in hair conditioner
		* "don't want to be ashy"
- Where they live, clothes they where, what they eat at home

Mouth in the Wall thoughts:
- Are you comitted to the Governor trying to erase history prior to arriving in UnderPortal? How does it show up? What history / cultures made it through regardless?

# Exercise 2 - Altered Adjectives
Describing characters with adjectives typically associated with other genders.
- This is an exercise
- Write descriptions of characters using adjectives not typically associated with their appearance / gender.
- Write descriptions from POV of different characters

# Lecture 2 - Insider Language and Slurs

## Identity-first vs. Person-first language
- Elsa Sjunneson taught this to K. Tempest
	+ master class on writing blind and deaf characters
- Use 'person' before, e.g. 'disability'
	+ 'deaf woman' vs. 'woman who is deaf'
- big conversation in the disability community
	+ still going on, will continue for a long time
- You don't have to make a decision here.
- Figure out which one your character prefers, and why they prefer that.
> It's important that we have the power to change how we are perceived

Think about the culture(s) in your fiction. Is person-first language a thing? Is identify-first the default in your world / work?
- this applies to other identities as well.
	+ what words to characters use to refer to their race? gender? etc
	+ do their parents agree?
		* e.g. 'people of color' is, to some people, just the person-first version of 'colored person'

## Slurs and In-group word
Words for identity slides right into the topic of slurs and in-topic words

- There are many people who use 'crip' or 'cripple' to reclaim the word, but they tend to use it within group, but won't use it with those outside the group.
- Recognize that there are "really nuanced feelings about the use of those words"
	+ some push in-group words into wider usage to attempt reclamation
	+ some people reject the wider-usage of slur
	+ see 'queer' and 'slut'

Is it okay to use slurs in description if characters would use the word?
- historical setting, character is a bigot, character doesn't know the word is offensive, character is from the group and might use it in test, within group.

Some guidelines:
1. If _you_ don't understand the nuance behind a slur's, just don't use it. Do your research to understand the in-group usage to understand whether you can use it, and run it by a sensitivity reader.
2. Some words are simply not for use. Just don't use them.
3. If you are creating a character who is unapologetic about slur usage, you are entering tricky land, craft-wise. You run the risk of readers assuming _you_ hold the ideas. Seek guidance and feedback the character as a whole. Consider craft reactions -- don't literally type the word onto the page (censor it, mention it indirectly)

## Exposition
A scary word for some people. This idea that 'exposition is bad' is a source for writers being bad at description, because 'avoid exposition' translates into "don't describe characters"
- [ ] Buy _Wonderbook_
- [ ] Read the essay on exposition
- [ ] Read _100 Years of Solitude_

Essay on embracing exposition in Wonderbook.
- "show don't tell" doesn't make sense.
- Reject the 'good/bad' dichotomy
- Whether a story is narrated or exposed, there is an equal chance of it being interesting

Don't let the establishment of modern fiction tell you what you can and can't write.
- What do you gain from the mythical idea of 'universality'?
	+ You end up writing for an audience that shares all your assumptions -- that's the only way to write 'universally'
- Many of the hallmarks of "good writing" rely on 'what is not said' -- but for that to work, your readers must share many assumptions with you.
	+ They rely on a pile of cultural assumptions.
	+ This leaves out any genre, craft, or experience that lies outside the body of shared culture of your readers.
		* Making 'the different' understandable requires a lot of explanation / 'exposition'

The CIA is responsible for this:
- [Workshops of Empire](https://www.uipress.uiowa.edu/books/9781609383718/workshops-of-empire)
	+ **Buy this book **
	+ The CIA pushed the idea that 'one culture is universal' to steer writers away from socialism
> The mainstream is constantly telling itself about itself.

> You don't have to treat *any* experience or culture as universal.

Don't be afraid of exposition. Learn to write it well.
>Done well, exposition becomes a huge part of the pleasure of fiction.

> Telling in every day life exists for more than the telling of simple information.
- there is pleasure in reliving, e.g. culinary experiences, when two real people tell each other about meals they all both know

A framework for exposition: The Ear of the Story
- [ ] There's a video coming up next week; watch it.
- who is hearing the story
- who is the character telling it to?
- are you tipping the story towards someone who knows the world? Someone who doesn't?

### Writing Good Exposition
It should be entwined w/ the plot, w/ characterization, etc. Don't eschew description and exposition. 

Master "The Storyteller's Voice"
- this voice is all about telling
Read authors who do exposition well:
- Samuel R. Delany’s Stars in my Pockets Like Grains of Sand
- Down Among the Sticks and Bones
	+ The first 1/4 is pages of exposition w/ small interruptions by scenes
- Redemption in Indigo by Karen Lord
- Middlegame (book)
- "The Orphans Tales" (duology)
- Catherine Velanti
	+ "Space Opera" (Ca)
- Kim Stanley Robinson
	+ "New York 2140"
- Scott Westerfell
	+ book about vampires
- Seveneaves

> Practice exposition, like description in general
- pull books, note when exposition shows up, and how+why
- find award-winning short stories and find exposition sentences

> Everything has a specificity to it that makes it interesting and unique and cool.
- Assuming everything is the same is just bad writing

The whole "show don't tell" thing excludes an entire mode of conveying stories
- "Telling" is the way stories are shared across many cultures.

# Issues with Description
- Avoid over-description, which breaks your readers' ability to visualize your character/setting *at all*.

- avoid "generous mouth"

Over-description happens when the writer tries to force the reader to see exactly what the author sees in their own minds. It's not possible.

> The more precise an artist is, the more lifeless it becomes.
- Your eye (and brain) fills in missing information
	+ We take it for granted in real-life, because we know the information is there.
	+ But too much info in fiction leads to the uncanny valley, where you _notice_ that there is too much information.
> Meet your brain halfway

Samuela R. Delany: [About Writing]
- Visualize everything as thoroughly as you can. Then: do not describe it. Mention only those aspects that impinge on your character's consciousness.

> Don't overwite.

You might need to write out your character's full physical description, but that description might not end up in the text.

Deliberate practice will produce words that no one else will see.

Remember, physical, outward appearance is only one part of creating characters in your readers' minds.

Mouth in the Wall
- If you put too much info into a Reader's head, they have nothing to suspend the information on, and they lose it.

# Exercise II - The Picture Game again
Really focus on physical descriptors.

Two more pictures, 15 minutes each.
(elderly white woman)
(elderly black woman)

Things I'm uncomfortable with:
- weight / size
- describing 'archetypal' face shapes: eyes, noses, mouths
	+ How would I describe an Ethiopian compared to a West African (e.g. Nigerian or Senegalese)
	+ I felt easier describing her moles and hair and shoulder blades

This is practice.

Be aware of whose voice you are using.
- "Breaking" some of the WtO guidelines can be super powerful when done to show a character's essence
	+ e.g. a character who describes others via food metaphors can be a powerful way to show that this character is, e.g. a nasty person who views others as people to be consumed
	+ Don't use food metaphors *unconsciously*, without thought

Sometimes, its good to just be direct.
"Almond eyes" is often a proxy for 'east-Asian' so just...say that.
- Do you even need to be that detailed in the describing?
	+ Do you need to describe every nose and eye you come across? Unless the character voice is specifically noticing it...maybe skip it? Stick with a less specific version?
- If you're going to focus on a feature, make sure the characters are invested enough to focus on that
- Could your character even tell the difference?
	+ K. Tempest's story about western Europeans being able to identify a Ukranian on sight.
	

Pressure to 'show' the specifity you are after re: describing a character as Ethiopoian (as opposed to another specificity like Nigerian) without telling it.

Diversion on describing fat characters:
- again, what would the character say / think
- more generally: referring to fat people is in flux. There is movement to push 'fat' into the mainstream, others want nothing to do with it.
- 'fat' is, to a degree, feminized.

Young children don't describe their parents as 'other'. Though by pre-teen, they'll have the social experience (and rebelliousness) to see their parents as different.

When trying to describe someone you don't find attractive (for whatever reason), think about them through the POV of someone who finds them very attractive and describe them. (As an exercise).

Which tools were helpful. Which weren't.
- Write a description of the character for yourself
- Write a description of the character from another character's POV
	+ What are you saying about the character, and what are you saying about the POV character?

- Shrinking the image to focus on the basics.

What are you still struggling with:
- vocabularies for things you are uncomfortable with
	+ Read books from people you are trying to represent. See how _they_ represent the features in question.

If you highlight phrases in google play, you'll get a google doc with all of your highlights.

# QA for first day
How can we write better about the unmarked state?
- Something that doesn't work too well: applying marginalized tropes to unmarked characters

> I associate descriptors like "Aquiline nose" with White people, mostly because I've seen that used quite a bit

We often use descriptors that aren't descriptive, but that assumes the reader knows what they mean:
- almond eyes
- cafe au lait skin
- white knuckling

Be aware of descriptors that are familiar to you
- TODO: add Murderbot to reading list

- Have you put multiple languages into your stories? You enjoy that Silver Spring has 3+ languages, why not put that into your stories? What about Burrow?

A good tool: find how individuals describe themselves (or others in their identity)
- e.g. 
	+ how do black women journalists write about Maxine Waters?
	+ how are women described in lesbian romance stories (written for women, not male gaze)
	+ how do fat authors describe overweight characters?

# End of Day 1
Two exercises to prepare for tomorrow.

# Day 2 Exercise - A Familiar Space

Another oddity: the fewer senses that we had that _I'm_ confident with, the more my narration became 2nd-person focused

# Day 2 Exercise - A Crowded Room

When marking characteristics, don't _over-mark_.  Not everytime a mobility-impaired person moves has to be marked, has to be a big thing.

- TODO: add "are you over-marking otherness" to your retro
	+ Marking something can be neutral - it doesn't have to be positive / negative
	+ Authors often write 'the mundane' -- do that for, e.g. altered mobility, w/o making it 'a challenge'

# Day 2 - Fascinating Facets

## Part 1
> Write a passage in which MC describes themselves in the first person. They can be talking to themselves in a mirror, to another person, or even you, the author.
> Pick a specific moment in time.

(Arc, when he first realizes he feels stunted in becoming a harvester.)

I'm Arc Extradni. I'm training to be a harvester like my Estrela-ma and apparently I'm going to be training for the rest of my life. I'm sixteen. I've been out here harvesting with Estrela-ma's crew since I was Siema's age, almost a decade now. I know how to be a harvester. I know how to *look* like I know how to be a harvester.

The rest of the crew trusts me, especially Gareth. I'm ready to harvest on my own. but Estrela-ma doesn't trust me to do so.

What? More about me? I'm taller than both of my mothers. I inherited the white skin of Ipa-ma, though I don't know where my height came from. Except for Gareth and Roreye, I'm taller than anyone else in the crew. Roreye and I both appreciate well fitting clothes. He and I spend time searching for pristine clothing, clothes without tears or patches. There's something about walking into the Circle Market dressed in bright fabric that's undamaged by usage or time. People notice. It feels good.

Siblings? Right, let's just introduce my whole family. Estrela-ma and Ipa-ma are my parents. Estrela-ma is an elected crew leader. She guides all forty of us outside the city center to harvest supplies every cycle. Ipa-ma is a Technominister. She's not as active as Estrela-ma and I, but she knows more than both of us combined.

## Part 2
> Using the same character, describe them in the third person.
<!-- 3rd person detached -->

Arc Extradni is a sixteen year old, the son of crew leader Estrela Extradni and Technominister Ipa Extradni. He is the eldest of three siblings, followed by his sister Robais (13) and brother Siema (9).

Arc accompanies his Estrela on her excursions out of the city center every cycle to harvest supplies for the Misison. His crew mates trust him, though his mother does not. Over fifty percent of his peer cohort has been granted the title of harvester, though Estrela has not put forth his name for consideration.

Arc dresses well, especially for a harvester. He and fellow crew-member Roreye XXXX spend much of their down time seeking out and bartering for pristine clothing and yards of fabric that can be turned into such.

Even at sixteen years old, Arc is tall, among the top five percent of all UnderPortal residents. He inherited Ipa's white skin and black hair, which he keeps well groomed, his Warehousers withdrawls for hair care products exceeds the eightieth percentile.

## Part 3
> Pick a different character from same WIP, someone who knows and likes, admires, loves, or looks up to them -- someone with positive feelings about them.
> Write a description of the original character through this new POV (first person).

(Writing a description of Arc through Siema's eyes)

Arc's the best big brother. He's so tall, he can reach food in the highest shelves. He can carry two bags filled with supplies without even noticing. When we're out harvesting with Estrela-ma, Arc let's me go with him to harvest a dry house.

He's shown me how to comb my hair and fold my clothes so that I can look sharp like him. He even brought me some hair gel from the Warehousers! I haven't used it yet because I don't want to mess it up, but I'm working up the courage to get it right.

One day, I'm going to be a harvester just like Arc. I know he isn't _actually_ a harvester yet, but Estrela-ma says he just needs a little more practice. He'll be a harvester soon enough.

I'm not always as neat as Arc, but I'm practicing. I kind of wish he had some more time outside of a harvest to spend time with me, but it takes a lot of effort to be as prepared as he is.

He has white skin, like me and Ipa-ma, and while my hair is dark brown, his is black. I try to keep mine as combed as his, but after I've been outside playing with my friends, mine always has hairs out of place. That's what Arc says all the time. "Out of place." Especially when he's looking at himself in a mirror with a comb in one hand.

My friend Parmil says that he really likes having a dad, but I can't imagine Parmil's dad is better than a big brother like Arc.
