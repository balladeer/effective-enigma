## What if?
Frame tale: Prince telling the story to the three (remaining) grandparents who control his father, the king
Layer 1 story is of Prince + Princess (his sister) discovering what happened to the King's big excavation.
- Readers know both siblings went, but the Frame tale makes it clear only one returned.
- At the end, we learn that the princess has forsaken her heritage and run off w/ the sentient artifact they discovered to try and avert the apocalypse
- Sentient weapon is one of the three POVs from the layer 2 stories, stricken by a curse.
	+ Refused to be stolen during the looting, used its new powers to wait for someone who would talk to it
